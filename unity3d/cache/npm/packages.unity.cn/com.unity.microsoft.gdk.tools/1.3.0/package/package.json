    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added support for Stable Key (lk) encryption when building the Windows standalone package using MakePkg.exe.\n\n### Fixed\n- \"VC14\" added as a \"KnownDependency\" in the final MGC to avoid the \"ILI_HasMissingDependency\" submission validation error.\n\n### Changed\n- The `Sideload Package` GDK Setting UI has changed to `Sideloadable Package`. Selecting this setting will still generate a test signed package as before however the package will now only be installed into the local Microsoft Store when using 'Build and Run'. This change makes it possible to generate a test signed package without it being installed automatically by using 'Build'. This is more appropriate for CI environments.\n- `GdkSettingsAsset.createScriptingDefine` is now marked as obsolete, please do not use. Changing this field will no longer take effect. The creation of `MICROSOFT_GDK_SETTINGS` is now controlled by 'Build for GDK'.\n- The 'Build for GDK' setting now automatically adds or removes the `MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT` pre-processor.\n- Changing the state of 'Build for GDK' will now prompt for a domain reload as this is required for the `MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT` pre-processor change to take immediate effect.\n- Pre-existing GdkSettingsAssets which have previously disabled `Build for GDK` on platforms that can only support GDK may find this setting disabled and unchecked. To re-enable the GdkSettingsAsset may need to be re-created.\n- The Windows Standalone post-process now deploys the `.DLLs` located in the `Plugins/GDK` folder when `Build for GDK` is enabled (automatically imported DLLs will be marked Editor only by default). \n\n### Removed\n- The UI for 'Define MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT' has been removed, this pre-processor is now added or removed based on 'Build for GDK'  \n\n### Known Issues\n-"
