This makes the assemblies available for in Editor Playmode whilst avoiding the assemblies being deployed to none-compatible target platforms. When using the __Microsoft GDK API__ package without the __Microsoft GDK Tools__ package, the developer will be responsible for ensuring that these assemblies are correctly deployed."
