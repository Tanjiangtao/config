        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Manual documentation for UnityObjectRef.\n* RemoteContentCatalogBuildUtility.PublishContent  will now create content sets for all objects and scenes, using the UntypedWeakReferenceId.ToString() as the name of the set.  This allows for downloading dependencies of specific objects and scenes.  For SubScenes, the content set is named with just the guid and contains the header, all entity section files, and any unity object references in content archives.\n* RemoteContentCatalogBuildUtility.PublishContent will now create a text file containing all remapping information.  This file will be created in the root of the remote content folder and is named DebugCatalog.txt.  This file shows how each file is remapped to its cache location and what its RemoteContentId is.  It also lists all content sets defined during the Publish step.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Instantiating an entity that doesn't have a LinkedEntityGroup will now behave the same as if the entity had a LinkedEntityGroup only containing the entity itself. It practice, it means that if the entity has components referencing the entity itself, those same components on the instances of that entity will always reference themselves. Previously, this only happened when an LinkedEntityGroup was present and it would leave the reference pointing to the original entity otherwise. That behavior was inconsistent and surprising.\n* EntityReferences, BlobReferences and UnityObjectReferences that are below the max search depth will be ignored. If they should not be ignored `ForceReferenceAttribute` should be added to the type.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Addressed a potential use after free when blob assets are recreated with identical content in open subscenes (live baking). This error only affected the editor and was a potential crash.\n* Removed two sources of internal compilation errors related to the use of invalid generic parameters in SystemAPI.Query. Only the regular C# errors will be reported.\n* RuntimeContentManager.WaitForCompletion in play mode in the editor now works.\n* Fixed issue where a base system class may not update correctly if a derived system is also present.\n* Content delivery initialization will now always download the content set named \"local_catalogs\", defined in ContentDeliveryGlobalState.kLocalCatalogsContentSet.  During the publish process, all .bin files are added to this content set.  This is done to ensure that all necessary local catalog files are downloaded before initialization ends.  The files that will end up in this set are ContentArchives/archive_dependencies.bin and EntityScenes/scene_info.bin.\n* Improved burstability of BlobAssetComputationContext. (Thanks tertle!)\n* Further reduced reflection on TypeManager startup.\n* Scheduling a job in Runtime from a method invocation will no longer throw `Exception: This method should have been replaced by source gen.`\n* \"BadImageFormatException: Expected reference type but got type kind 17\" no longer happens when you have a generic ISystem MyISystem and then T and/or the RegisterGenericSystem declaration are not in the same assembly as MyISystem.\n* Assemblies that have no systems defined, but do have `[assembly: RegisterGenericSystemType()]` calls are no longer skipped, and the systems are registered.\n* Compilation will not fail in ILPostProcessing when you have a shared component with bool System.IEquatable<YourSharedComponent>.Equals(YourSharedComponent other) rather than bool Equals(YourSharedComponent other).\n* TypeManager.IsZeroSized will now correctly be true for component data that only has static fields.\n* When having a UnityObjectReference, a BlobReference and a EntityReference, the UnityObjectReference would be ignored through a faulty early-out.\n\n### Security"

This allows for creating the update with only the files included in the catalog instead of just copying everything in the folder, which can lead to unwanted files getting included.\n* New `ArchetypeChunk.GetBufferAccessorRO<T>()` and `ArchetypeChunk.GetBufferAccessorRW<T>()` methods allow users to request a specific access mode to a chunk's buffer component data, potentially avoiding an unnecessary write dependency when asking for read-only access through a read-write type handle.\n* New `ArchetypeChunk.GetUntypedBufferAccessorReinterpret<T>(ref DynamicComponentTypeHandle, int expectedSize)` method allows creating a typed `BufferAccessor` from an untyped component handle. The source and destination buffer types must be safely aliasable in memory, including both the element size and internal buffer capacity.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Updated the `com.unity.burst` dependency to version `1.8.19`\n* Entities.ForEach marked as obsolete.

Component and EntityQuery APIs should be used directly in the future instead of Aspects.  Both Entities.ForEach and Aspects will remain supported in 1.x packages of Entities.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* Deprecated `ComponentLookup.GetRefRWOptional()` and `ComponentLookup.GetRefROOptional()`. These methods should only be used to implement the `[Optional]` attribute in Aspect source generation, and should never have been part of the package's public API. User code should prefer the new `TryGetRefRO()` and `TryGetRefRW()` methods.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Optimized usage of `IEntitiesPlayerSettings.GetFilterSettings()` by hoisting getting `BakingSystemFilterSettings` out of loops.\n* The debug checks in AddComponent methods to protect against exceeding the maximum size of a single entity now handle chunk components correctly.\n* Bug where Debug Breakpoints weren't hit correctly when you had comments in your ISystem/SystemBase code.\n* InvalidOperationException when Exclusive Entity Transaction was pending while creating Entity Remap Array\n* Slight performance improvement on SetSharedComponentManaged.\n* fixed compile error when an IJobEntity is inside a namespace which contains conditional using statements\n* No longer get an SGICE002 when typing incomplete/invalid typeargs e.g. SystemAPI.Query<RefRW<>>\n* Failure to add IJobEntity Attributes like WithAll, WithOptions etc when using full attribute name e.g. WithAllAttribute\n* Failure to query for the right component when using generic component with copy semantic e.g. `SystemAPI.Query<Holder<int>>` would query `int` instead of `Holder<int>`\n* CompanionComponents no longer throw an error in LiveBaking when being updated.\n* Fixed horizontal alignment of field values when viewing `WeakObjectReference` and `UnityObjectRef` instances in the Inspector.\n* a memory leak was reported from the EntitiesComponentStore upon entering playmode a second time from the editor if at least one entity was created with the custom bootstrap disabled (`UNITY_DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP`, `UNITY_DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP_RUNTIME_WORLD` or `UNITY_DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP_EDITOR_WORLD`).

As a side effect, queries with `WithAny` constraints should now have slightly faster matching.\n* For empty scene sections, `SceneSectionData.BoundingVolume` will no longer contain NaN values, and the `BoundingVolume.IsValid` property will return `true` as expected. Note that converting this field to an `AABB` will still result in NaN values; for now, this case will need special-case handling in user code.\n* Massively reduced reflection on startup in player builds by moving work to an ILPostProcessor.\n* Unit test Instability (memory corruption) caused by dynamically registering new types with the TypeManager.\n\n### Security"

This feature works in narrow contexts, but is known to cause errors and incompatibilities with other DOTS features.\n* Add API docs to note that enabling and disabling components inside `IJobEntityChunkBeginEnd.OnChunkBegin()` does not affect the entities iterated in the current chunk, as its `chunkEnabledMask` has already been computed.\n* Zero-size `IBufferElementData` and `ISharedComponentData` structs no longer cause the TypeManager to throw during initialization. Zero-size buffer and shared components are usually a sign of pointless waste (especially buffer components, which have a significant chunk-memory cost even if the actual elements are empty), but they shouldn't cause a fatal error.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Various SGICE002 errors that happen if you type invalid C# code\n* Various SGICE003 errors that happen if you type invalid C# code\n* NullReferenceException on UnityObjectRef<T> after Asset Garbage Collection (This fix requires editor versions 2022.3.43f1 and 6000.0.16f1 and beyond)"

This is generally more efficient that setting the value on each individual entity.\n\n### Changed\n\n* The internal capacity of `Child` buffer components is reduced from 8 to 0, improving the chunk utilization of parent entities.\n* The internal capacity of `LinkedEntityGroup` buffer components is reduced from 1 to 0, improving the chunk utilization of prefabs and prefab instances.\n* `EnabledMask.GetOptionalEnabledRef*()` were renamed to `EnabledMask.GetEnabledRef*Optional()` for consistency.\n* `EntityQuery.GetCombinedComponentOrderVersion()` now takes a `bool` parameter to indicate whether the `Entity` component type should be included. The existing variant of this method is now marked as deprecated.\n* Improved performance of the `LocalToWorldSystem` when processing entity transform hierarchies, by distributing work more evenly across worker threads.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* `EntityQuery.GetEntityQueryDesc()` should no longer be used; it only returns the target query's first query description element. Use the new `.GetEntityQueryDescs()` method instead to retrieve the full list. If only the first element is needed, use `query.GetEntityQueryDescs()[0]`.\n\n### Removed\n\n* The `EnabledMask` constructor was removed from the public API. Its inclusion was an error, and it is impossible to call safely from user code. The correct way to create these objects is through `ArchetypeChunk.GetEnabledMask()`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* `EnabledRefRW<T>` now throws when attempting to write through an invalid or uninitialized instance.\n* Creating an `EntityQuery` with multiple `EntityQueryDesc` (or by using `EntityQueryBuilder.AddAdditionalQuery()`) now correctly matches archetypes that match one of the query's descriptions other than the first.\n* Entities windows do not throw exceptions anymore when installing or removing packages from package manager.\n* Debug proxies (used by external debuggers) were sometimes using invalid field offsets when inspecting structs in blob assets. This led to incorrect values being reported in debugger watch windows. In particular, this would be triggered by the use of bool fields in blob asset structs.\n* Entity version numbers could go back to 1 after reallocation in some edge cases.\n* When building a content update, a temporary path was getting created in the drive root instead of the Library folder.  This would also cause content update builds to grow in size every time they were built.  The folder is now created in the Library correctly.\n* IL2CPP compilation errors in patched methods (using codegen features) that also contain local functions.\n* Removed a potential source of non-determinism in the chunk header when serializing entities scenes.\n* the content of the archive_dependencies.bin and archive_dependencies.txt files in builds is now deterministic.\n* SystemAPI.GetSingletonBuffer<T>(readOnly: ...) now correctly passes the argument (aka, you can now correctly get a readonly DynamicBuffer)\n* Error in build when sprites are contained in subscenes has been removed.\n\n### Security\n\n\n### Known Issues"

This means an unmanaged IComponentData can reference Unity assets and it works in a build or from a loaded SubScene the same as with Managed components.\n* IEntitySceneBuildAdditions Interface to force the addition of unreferenced SubScenes into a build.\n* `ArchetypeChunk.SetComponentEnabledForAll()` method to enable or disable a component on all entities in the chunk. This is more efficient than calling `SetComponentEnabled()` on each entity individually.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Update package `com.unity.mathematics` from `1.2.6` to `1.3.1` version.\n* Error message when attempting to schedule an IJobChunk while an exclusive entity transaction is active.\n* obsolete `EventBase.PreventDefault()` removed or changed for `StopPropagation` in `2023.2` or higher.\n* obsolete `FindObjectsOfType<T>()` changed for `FindObjectsByType<T>()` in `2023.2` or higher.\n* Shortened file names for source generator projects and test verification results.\n* Several `EntityCommandBuffer` commands will now correctly fix up Entity references within component values in recorded commands, to replace temporary entities created at record-time with the corresponding \"final\" entities created at playback time. These include commands that add/set unmanaged shared components, commands targeting an entity's `LinkedEntityGroup`, and `AddComponent<T>(NativeArray<Entity>, T)`.\n* The minimum supported editor version is now 2022.3.11f1\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* `CopyAndReplaceEntitiesFrom` is unreliable and should be avoided. Entities are not the same across worlds anymore, so an optional remapping table can be passed to the function in order to look up which entity in the destination world corresponds a given entity in the source world.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed issue where Entities IL post-processors were causing output assemblies to be non-deterministic between compilations.\n* Ensure consistency in how the `==`/`!=` operators and the `Equals()`/`GetHashCode()` methods in `ComponentType` are implemented.\n* UnityException: Calls to \"AssetDatabase.RegisterCustomDependency\" are restricted during importing when saving the EntitiesClientSettings assets.\n* Minor performance optimization to EntityQuery.ToComponentArray when used with a managed component type.\n* Issue where Burst would fail to compile an Entities.ForEach or Job.WithCode, resulting in a runtime casting error.\n* Journaling can now be enabled even if no default world initialization is used.\n* You can now exit playmode while having an Entity with a buffer selected in the Entities Hierarchy, without getting any errors.\n* Streaming hitches when using a lot of Companion Components (e.g. Lights) in a SubScene\n* Fixed false-positive error check in `EntityCommandBuffer.AddComponent<T>(NativeArray<Entity>, T)`.\n* Validation for world's existence before accessing within `EntitySelectionProxy`.\n* `ArchetypeChunk.SetComponentEnabled(DynamicComponentTypeHandle)` will now throw an exception if the provided component type does not implement `IEnableableComponent`.\n* An exception thrown during world deserialization could cause a memory leak.\n\n### Security"

E.g. `EntityManager.CreateEntity( stackalloc[] { ComponentType.ReadOnly<Type1>(), ... } )`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Iterating through a generic type using `System.Query` now triggers an actionable error message informing users that doing so is unsupported.\n* Nested `SystemAPI` invocations that previously trigger the `InvalidOperationException` no longer do so.\n* `#if` directives surrounding `using` directives are now correctly handled during source generation.\n* Source-generators now correctly patch methods that contain pointer parameters.\n* Disabled components that are also used as changed filters are now backed by correctly generated queries.\n* The `World` is now validated in the `EntityContainer` before the `EntityManager` is accessed. Meaning you can now exit playmode while having an Entity with a buffer selected in the Entities Hierarchy, without getting any errors.\n* Avoid a potential `NullReferenceException` when creating an `EntityQuery` with multiple query descriptions.\n* The component dependency manager now completes registered jobs in batches, instead of individually. This reduces the overhead of structural changes and other sync points.\n* Managed component types with circular references to other managed types (e.g. TypeA contains a field of TypeB, and TypeB contains a field of TypeA.) previously could have non-deterministic StableTypeHashes causing issues when deserializing entities data. Note, this fix raises the serialization version for all `.entities` files, requiring all previously serialized entity data requiring to be reserialized as the StableTypeHashes generated will no longer match. **Fix requires Unity 2022.3.1f11 or greater to work properly in IL2CPP builds**\n* Fixed several memory leaks in the package and its test suite.\n* `ScratchpadAllocator.Dispose()` now fully restores the object to its uninitialized state.\n* `EntityCommandBuffer` no longer leaks `DynamicBuffers` when using `PlaybackPolicy.Multiplayback`.\n* `EntityCommandBuffer.Dispose()` no longer throws an exception when called on a command buffer that was not fully initialized.\n* `World.DestroyAllSystemsAndLogException()` (called during `World.Dispose()`) no longer prematurely aborts its loop if a system threw an exception from its `OnDestroy()` method. This prevented all subsequent systems from being destroyed, leaking all of their resources.\n* Scheduling `IJobEntity` instances using `IJobEntityExtensions` no longer triggers `SGICE002`.\n* When selecting `Publish -> Content Update` in a project that uses the `Entities` package, the `DirectoryNotFoundException` is no longer thrown."

Implementations of these methods, like all existing methods in `Unity.Entities.IAspectCreate<T>`, will automatically be generated on users' behalf by source generators.\n* Added `IBaker.CreateAdditionalEntities` for creating multiple additional entities at once.\n* filter to search with SharedComponent from within the Hierarchy Window\n* filter to search with SharedComponent from within the Search Window\n* New `EntityQuery` component type constraint: `Present` components are required to be present on a query's matching archetypes, whether or not they are enabled or disabled on individual entities. This constraint can be added in all the usual places -- `EntityQueryBuilder.WithPresent<T>()`, `EntityQueryDesc.Present[]`, the `[WithPresent(typeof(T))]` attribute on `IJobEntity`, etc.\n* checks to see if an exclusive transaction is active while scheduling a job.\n* Specific error when capturing a variable in `Entities.ForEach` that relies on relies on source generators (since there is no deterministic order between source generators, this can be an error).\n\n### Changed\n\n* Significantly improved the performance of `EntityManager.SetSharedComponent<T>(EntityQuery,T)` and `EntityManager.SetSharedComponentManaged<T>(EntityQuery,T)`\n* `TypeManager.Initialize` will disable synchronous Burst compilation only during initialization of the TypeManager so that large synchronous compilation stalls when compiling function pointers can be avoided when iterating in the Editor.\n* BlobBuilder is now partial\n* CompanionGameObjectUpdateTransformSystem is now public\n* ResetUpdateAllocator is now public\n* SubSceneInspectorUtility is now public\n* Batch primary entity creation in baking.\n* `HasSingleton<T>()` and `TryGetSingleton<T>()` methods will now throw if they find >1 instance of `T`, instead of returning `false`. Having more than one instance of a singleton component indicates a bug in the program, and should fail more obviously.\n* The visibility of the `EnabledBitUtility` class was changed from `public` to `internal`. This class was never intended to be part of the public API of the Entities package, and should not be used by application code.\n* `EntityManager.AddChunkComponentData(EntityQuery,T)` no longer throws an exception if the component `T` is already present on any of the target chunks. Instead, the new value is assigned to the existing component. This matches the behavior of other AddComponent variants in the Entities package.\n* Text for exception that occurs when an entity doesn't exist during EntityCommandBuffer playback.\n* `IJobChunk` now allows indexed writes to native containers passed in the job struct. Only writes to the element at `unfilteredChunkIndex` are valid. To disable this check on a per-container basis, add `[NativeDisableParallelForRestriction]` to the relevant field in the job struct.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* Deprecate GetSharedComponentDataIndex as it is a dupplicate of GetSharedComponentIndex\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed gizmo rendering logic for entities from C#, now this is handled natively in Unity.\n* Marked `EntityManager.Instantiate(NativeArray<Entity> srcEntities, NativeArray<Entity> outputEntities)` as obsolete, with the intention to eventually remove it entirely.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Code fix now available to rewrite offending code that trigger `CS1654` errors.\n* Fixed a typo in the \"LocalTransform\" summary comment.\n* Property drawer for arrays and lists of Weak(Object|Scene)Reference types\n* Compilation with DISABLE_ENTITIES_JOURNALING works again.\n* Ensure Component gizmos are rendered for GameObjects in SubScenes when rendered with Entities. That is when using Preferences->Entities->SceneView Mode -> Runtime Data.\n* Added null checks in BlobAssetReferenceData properties to avoid crashing the engine while inspecting variables with the debugger.\n* LocalTransform.FromMatrixSafe would throw exceptions for valid matricies\n* IJobEntity overwriting files due to colliding filenames.\n* Differ discards ChunkComponents added during baking.\n* Fixed issue with BakingVersion(true) triggering warnings in the console log about the attribute being missing on the type you placed this on in cases where named BakingVersion attributes are being used in the containing assembly.\n* A source generator error is not thrown anymore when using the fully qualified name of `SystemAPI.Time` (e.g. `Unity.Entities.SystemAPI.Time`).\n* The main entity in LinkedEntityGroups were not added in incremental baking.\n* Fix memory leak in the BakerEntityUsage not disposing properly the list of ReferencedEntityUsage\n* Fixed `isReadOnly` being ignored in `EntityManager.GetBuffer`.\n* ArgumentException on an unknown type when using the GetComponent API in a baker with an abstract type.\n* Subscenes no longer redundantly rebake on recompile due to type order changes.\n* Serialization of blob asset references in unmanaged shared components\n* `SystemGenerator` in the source-generation solution runs in ~48% less time when tested on a small game project shared by one of our users.\n* You now no longer get a compile error for methods containing SystemAPI, EFE, or IJE scheduling, that include a signature with nullables, multiple generics, or parameter modifiers.\n* KeyNotFoundException thrown by the  Entities.Editor.HierarchyWindow when loading a new gameobject scene\n* Users can now specify duplicate components in the same `IJobEntity.Execute()` method, insofar as exactly one of them is wrapped in `EnabledRef<T>`.\n* Fixed issue where ambiguous types used in a `SystemAPI.Query<T>()` call would generate a compiler error from source generators.\n* Entities Hierarchy: when entering playmode without fast enter playmode the hierarchy was showing the authoring datamode content even though the switch in the window header was showing the mixed datamode.\n* Validation for world's existence before accessing within EntityContainer and EntitySelectionProxy."

The safe and easy fix is to add `EntityQueryCaptureMode.AtRecord` to all call sites; however, users are encouraged to review all call sites to see if the faster `.AtPlayback` mode would be appropriate.\n\n### Removed\n\n* Alignment attribute is removed when displaying component attributes in Inspector window.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Updated code samples in documentation for building content archives and content delivery.\n* Systems window's tree view indents are now enforced to the proper width.\n* Systems window's world and namespace columns are now left aligned.\n* You now can register generic ISystems so that they can be discovered and created automatically with world creation, or created manually via CreateSystem. Register each generic instance of them with `[assembly: RegisterGenericSystemType(typeof(YourGenericSystem<YourParticularType>))]` to allow such usage.\n* Entities Hierarchy: Fix an exception happening when dragging a gameobject over a subscene node.\n* Entities Hierarchy: Disable Empty Scene menu item when creating new subscenes where the main scene is not saved.\n* Entities Hierarchy: fix a missing dispose in change collectors.\n* Current selection is cleared if an object is selected outside Systems window.\n* Current selection is cleared if an object is selected outside Components window.\n* Current selection is cleared from Components window when entering/exiting play mode.\n* Native memory leak when creating EntityQuery with EntityManager.CreateEntityQuery\n* Ensures both readers and writer dependencies are completed when accessing read/write components in certain code paths\n* Fixed a crash happening in `EntityCommandBuffer.Dispose` due to a use-after-free bug\n* `TypeManager` methods such as `GetSystemName` previously could crash after adding new system type information at runtime due to the `TypeManager` referring to invalid memory.\n* Bursted generic ISystems defined in one assembly and registered in another no longer break compilation."

This never fully worked or was fully implemented.  Instead, try using APIs, like SystemAPI.Query, IJobEntity and IJobChunk. These all work with both local functions and lambdas.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* SystemAPI methods now work inside of partial methods.\n* All aspect generated type references to their full name beginning with `global::` (Type Shadowing)\n* Do not generate aspect from type with shadowed IAspect type\n* Fixed sourcegen issues with user types and namespaces that conflict with Unity and Entities types.\n* Identically named types in different namespaces no longer trigger `CS0128` and `CS1503` when used as parameters in `IJobEntity.Execute()`.\n* If you update multiple packages, create a new section with a new header for the other package.\n* Assets loaded in edit mode through the content system are not forcibly unloaded.\n* LocalToWorld.Transform now works with nonuniform scale\n* Introduce clear error message (`SGJE0023`) when parameter types in `IJobEntity.Execute()` methods are less accessible than the `IJobEntity` types in which they are used.\n* `EntityCommandBuffer.AddComponent<T>(Entity)` for managed `T` no longer leaves the managed component store in an invalid state.\n* The constructor for `ComponentTypeSet` no longer throws an exception if the provided list of component types is empty.\n* `EntityManager.AddSharedComponent<T>(EntityQuery,T)` and `EntityManager.AddSharedComponentManaged<T>(EntityQuery,T)`now set the shared component `T` to the provided value, even if the target chunk already has component `T`. This changes makes this method consistent with other \"add component and set to value\" operations. *All existing call sites should be reviewed to ensure that they're not relying on the function's previous behavior!*\n* `EntityManager.DestroyEntity(EntityQuery)` had an undocumented constraint: if any of the target entities have a `LinkedEntityGroup` buffer component, the entities in that buffer must also match the target query. This constraint is now documented, and consistently applied in all code paths of this function.\n* You now can register generic ISystems so that they can be discovered and created automatically with world creation, or created manually via CreateSystem. Register each generic instance of them with `[assembly: RegisterGenericSystemType(typeof(YourGenericSystem<YourParticularType>))]` to allow such usage.\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* Some errors are surfaced when importing the Entities package into a 2D project. To bypass this issue, restart the editor once the package has been imported."

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* TypeManager.IsSystemTypeIndex was made internal as this function should not be needed as part of the public API.\n* Added `bool EnabledBitUtility.TryGetNextRange(v128 mask, int firstIndexToCheck, out int nextRangeBegin, out int nextRangeEnd)` as a replacement for `bool EnabledBitUtility.GetNextRange(ref v128 mask, ref int beginIndex, ref int endIndex)`. All usages of the latter method have been updated and the latter method deleted.\n* `bool EnabledBitUtility.TryGetNextRange(v128 mask, int firstIndexToCheck, out int nextRangeBegin, out int nextRangeEnd)` is introduced as a replacement for `bool EnabledBitUtility.GetNextRange(ref v128 mask, ref int beginIndex, ref int endIndex)`. All usages of the latter method have been updated and the latter method deleted.\n* Roslyn analyzer to detect and produce a warning for missing BurstCompile attributes on types containing methods marked with the BurstCompile attribute.\n* Message in subscene component to clarify the behaviour of opened subscenes in playmode\n* \"using\" document for TransformHelpers\n* missing inverse transform operations in TransformHelpers.\n* Use ComponentSystemGroup.GetAllSystems to get the list of systems in update order that live in that group.\n* SystemTypeIndex is now the preferred way to refer to systems, rather than using reflection and Type. Many methods now have versions that take a SystemTypeIndex or a NativeList<SystemTypeIndex>, and these avoid unnecessary reflection.\n* Property drawers for EntitySceneReference and EntityPrefabReference\n* Write a StreamingAssetFiles.manifest file in the build folder of webgl builds containing all files in the streaming asset folder.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Rename Unity.Entities.Transform.Helpers to  Unity.Entities.Transform.TransformHelpers.\n* Burst compiled moving unmanaged shared components during integration of subscenes into the target world, which improves streaming performance\n* If you use JetBrains Rider, you will now get an error for not using the returned JobHandle of an IJobEntity. This is done to clearly distinquish `IJobEntity.Schedule()` from `IJobEntity.Schedule(default(JobHandle)`. As for the latter, where a JobHandle is returned, you should handle whether you want to do complete the job then and there e.g. `handle.Complete()`. Or continue the chain e.g. `state.Dependency = handle` .\n* ComponentSystemGroup.Systems renamed to ManagedSystems, and introduce GetUnmanagedSystems if you only want the unmanaged ones.\n* Reduced the amount of memory allocated by allocating based on the maximum number of worker threads the running platform requires rather than defaulting to using a theoretical upper-bound of 128 worker threads.\n* You can again have an unlimited number of Create/Update Before/After attributes.\n* Includes unit tests.\n* No documentation changes or additions were necessary.\n* Updated Burst version to 1.8.4\n* Updated Serialization version to 3.1.0\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed ability to get/convert a RefRW as read-only status.  Please use RefRO instead, which should have more type safety.\n* Removed ability to an Aspect with read-only status.  It is possible to create another Aspect type that wraps a read-only aspect that communicates read-write access (and maintains type safety).\n* Warning about entities with no SceneSection not being serialized.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Allow components to contain NativeContainers whose element type is or contains a NativeContainer. Previously the TypeManager would throw during initialization if a component contained a a nested NativeContainer field. Note: NativeContainers still cannot be verified to be safely accessed when used in jobs. Thus, if a component contains a nested NativeContainer field, that component can only be accessed from the main thread.\n* improved error message when `EntityQuery.GetSingleton()` fails\n* Query window minimum size and scrolling behavior.\n* Query window internal state initialization.\n* Fixed a case where subscene importing could get stuck in some cases when an asset the subscene depends on changes midimport\n* Add null checks in Systems window.\n* Fixed a potential crash when loading managed component data in sub scenes on PS4 and PS5.\n* Companion objects leaking in Editor when loading and unload Entity scenes containing them.\n* `.WithSharedComponentFilter()` usages in different `Entities.ForEach` and `IFE` iterations no longer interfere with one another.\n* ManualOverride in incremental baking\n* Fix internal compiler error if event handler invocations occur in Entities.ForEach.\n* Don't wait on synchronously compiling CompileFunctionPointer to load.\n* Incremental baking with intermediate entities with TransformUsageFlags.None\n* Entities Hierarchy: Potential initialization errors.\n* Fix IJobEntityExtensions.Run(job) throwing an ICE.\n* No more memory leaks caused by the generated code for `IJobEntity` types, since we are no longer allocating `UnsafeList`s which are never disposed of.\n* RuntimeContentSystem was not getting updated when the default set of Worlds was changed\n* Bake dependencies on Transform now depends on the hierarchy.\n* Incremental baking with ManualOverride when a new component is added.\n* Fixes small memory leaks that occurred during domain reload where static native allocations were not cleaned up.\n* Fixes memory leak where entity scene catalogs would not be freed when the scene system is destroyed.\n* Fixed issue where Entities.ForEach was always supplying burst compilation parameters even if you did not provide them.\n* You can now schedule `IJobEntity` instances with custom queries insofar as these custom queries have all the components required for the jobs' `Execute()` methods to run.\n* Allow Entities Hierarchy to be reloaded via the hamburger menu \"Reload Window\" menu item\n* Fixed a memory leak that would occur when selecting Entities.\n* Companion components with negative scale\n* Fix misleading error message when invalid identifier is captured in Entities.ForEach.\n* Fixed issue with a managed component in an IJobEntity with a ref/in keyword caused generated C# errors. Using in/ref now generates a valid error.\n* When a ComponentSystemGroup calls OnStopRunning, ensure unmanaged systems also call OnStopRunning\n* `Job.WithCode()` can now capture multiple local variables correctly.\n* Systems with only `Job.WithCode` invocations no longer throw runtime exceptions.\n* SystemAPI Issue where using a resolved generic like MyGenericComp<MyData> as a typeargument would give SGSA0001. You can now e.g. do `SystemAPI.GetBufferLookup<MyGenericElement<int>>`.\n* Issue where EFE.WithStructuralChange have broken breakpoints and SystemAPI calls were unsupported. Note: those cases now also no longer support lambda expressions.\n* Resetting a blob asset reference to null would sometimes lead to an invalid reference in the destination world during live baking.\n* A relatively rare hash collision would happen if you had two unmanaged shared components that had the same exact data in them.\n* Fixed the types the Drawers are assigning to the WeakReferencesIds.\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* Jobs using using components (such as `IJobEntity` job types or jobs containing `ComponentLookup` types) scheduled may be synchronized more often than necessary.\n* `SystemAPI` methods do not work in partial or static methods.\n* `Entities.ForEach` with both `WithStructuralChanges` and `SystemAPI` methods can cause exceptions to be thrown and no breakpoints to be hit.\n* `RefRO` and `RefRW` parameters in `IJobEntity` that wrap types with the same name can cause compilation errors.\n* Throwing an exception in an `Entities.ForEach` or `SystemAPI.Query` block will cause subsequent systems to also throw.\n* Using local functions or lambdas inside of `Entities.ForEach` or `Jobs.WithCode` can cause invalid code-generation or run-time errors.\n* It is not possible to view or debug generated code yet in Visual Studio (this does work in Rider).\n* It is not possible to have an `IJobEntity` withthe same component wrapped in both an `EnabledRefRW`/`EnabledRefRO` and `RefRW`/`RefRO` types."

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Added support for automatic data mode switching to the Entities Hierarchy window and the Inspector window.\n* Added BlobAsset safety check for passing blob assets into methods without using `ref`.\n* Added the `LocalTransform.ComputeWorldTransformMatrix()` which synchronously computes an entity's world-space transform matrix, in the rare cases where an accurate world transform is needed in simulation code and is otherwise be unavailable.\n* Added `RefRW<T> SystemAPI.GetComponentRW<T>(Entity,bool)`\n* Bulk SetComponentEnabled operations on EntityManager: `EntityManager.SetComponentEnabled<T>(EntityQuery, bool)` and `EntityManager.SetComponentEnabled(EntityQuery, ComponentType, bool)`.\n* A `Unity.Transforms.Helpers` class with assorted transform-related helper functions:\n  * A simple `float4x4` extension methods for field extraction, such as `.Up()`, `.Forward()` and `.Translation()`\n  * Added utilities to apply a transformation matrix to a `float3` point or direction, or to a `quaternion` rotation\n  * A method to synchronously compute an entity's world-space transform, `.ComputeWorldTransformMatrix()`\n  * A method to compute the \"LookAt\" `quaternion` rotation for a position that would cause its \"forward\" direction to point towards some target.\n* `TypeIndex.IsChunkSerializable` property has been added to identify if a component type is valid in a chunk that is intended to be serialized. If `SerializeUtility.SerializeWorld` (such as might be called while exporting a subscene) is used to serialize chunks that contain components whose `TypeIndex.IsChunkSerializable` returns false, an exception will be thrown telling you why the component type is inappropriate for serialization.\n* Added `WeakSceneReference Unload(Scene scene)` method to unload the scene instance and release its resources.\n* Added guidance to GetSingleton error message\n* Transform Usage Flags\n* Added support for managed (shared) components serialization in DOTS runtime.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Moved the tool for adding missing `partial` keywords to system and job types from Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Entities into a Roslyn codefix. Your IDE of choice should now be able to fix this for you, and give you a red squiggly line if it's missing.\n* IJobEntity no longer gives a compile error if you have a reference type field. This improves iteration time, and has the added benefit that you can now write managed code in an IJobEntity. Simply add a managed component to your IJE's Execute (that forces running without the jobsystem). Your job can now validly use that field. If you try to schedule this job rather than running it on the main thread, you'll correctly get thrown a runtime error for having a reference type in your job.\n* Improved performance of IJobEntity generator, speeding up compile times. Attributes like WithAll, WithAny etc. now use syntax information directly. This mean that you can't make your own attribute on an IJobEntity named `WithAll` `WithAny`, `WithNone`, `WithDisabled`, `WithAbsent`, `WithOptions`, or `WithChangeFilter`.\n* Updated Burst dependency version to 1.8.3.\n* What was PostTransformScale as a float3x3 is now PostTransformMatrix as a float4x4. This is more general and offers maximum flexibility. You can, for example, use it to scale from a secondary pivot.\n* ParentSystem removes the Parent component if said component points to an entity that doesn't exist anymore.\n* Refactored how additive scenes are handled within the Runtime Content Manager. A scene is now returned, and that is used as the key to unload. This change required some API changes.\n* Changed `WeakObjectSceneReference.LoadAsync` to return the Scene instance, which should be used to check the loading status and for unloading.\n* Changed `RuntimeContentManager.UnloadScene` method to take the Scene instance as the only parameter.\n* The BlobAssetStore used during baking now uses garbage collection instead of an explicit refcount. It is not required anymore to register blobs with authoring GameObjects nor to do explicit cleanup in incremental baking systems.\n* Source generators for Systems and Aspects no longer default to outputting generated files in `Temp/GeneratedCode/***`. To turn it on, add `DOTS_OUTPUT_SOURCEGEN_FILES` to your Scripting Defines in Player Settings. Turning it on will cost compilation time. (The source generator for IJobEntity already made this change earlier.)\n* Moved InternalCompilerInterface, EntityQueryEnumerator (now InternalEntityQueryEnumerator) and some other types and methods to the Unity.Entities.Internal namespace.  These types and methods are not intended for use by user code. We would make them internal, but source generators won't work correctly that way unfortunately.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* Deprecated `WeakSceneReference` Release method. Unload should now be used and the scene instance returned by LoadAsync needs to be passed in as a ref.\n* `RegisterBindingAttribute(Type runtimeComponent, string runtimeField, bool generated)`. Vector type fields can now be registered automatically without the `generated` option.\n* SceneSystem.UnloadParameters and the overload of SceneSystem.UnloadScene receiving SceneSystem.UnloadParameters as parameters.\n* `EntityQuery.SetEnabledBitsOnAllChunks` as the only bulk operation on EntityQuery instead of EntityManager. Use the newly added bulk `SetComponentEnabled` overloads instead.\n* WeakSceneReference properties LoadingStatus, SceneResult, SceneFileResult.\n* RuntimeContentManager methods GetSceneLoadingStatus, GetSceneFileValue, GetSceneValue\n\n### Removed\n\n* `ENABLE_TRANSFORM_V1` define and existing transform v1 code. Transform v2 is now the only transform system.\n* Tooling to re-write user files to add missing partial keywords to systems.\n* The `TransformAspect` struct was removed. Recent changes to the Entities transform systems made the current implementation of `TransformAspect` much less useful, and we've decided to remove it from the package until we can provide a more valuable abstraction over the DOTS transform components.\n* The `EntityQueryEnumerator.EntityCount` field has been removed from the public API. Note that `EntityQueryEnumerator` is only intended for use by DOTS source generators.\n* `BlobAssetComputationContext` made internal.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Baker IEntitiesPlayerSettings were not setup correctly if the com.unity.platforms package was not installed/present in the project.\n* IJobEntity now no longer caches the default query when scheduling with a dynamic query. For example. `new MyJob().Schedule();` will use the query matching its execute signature whereas `new MyJob().Schedule(myQuery)` will now only use myQuery. This is useful in cases like RequireMatchingQueriesForUpdate, where you don't want to accidentally create extra queries.\n* Jobs implementing IJobEntity can now be created in one assembly and scheduled in another.\n* The `[WithDisabled]` attribute when applied to a job implementing `IJobEntity` now overrides the implicit `All` query defined by the signature of `Execute`. E.g. `Execute(MyComp a)` and `[WithDisabled(typeof(MyComp))]` now defines a query of EntityQuery(all={}, disabled=MyComp). This is useful in cases where you want to enable all components of type X which are present, but disabled.\n* `WriteGroup` support in transform v2 `LocalToWorldSystem` code should now work correctly.\n* Fixed compilation issue with 23.1/23.2*\n* Detection of circular ordering dependencies between systems is now correct.\n* Chaining `EntityQuery` methods with bulk operation methods is now supported.\n* Docs and samples for ECB systems now accurately reflect recommended usage. Fixed issue during `TypeManager.Initialize` where managed components with a field containing a circular type definition may throw `ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.`\n* Calling Release on a `WeakObjectReference<GameObject>` will no longer log errors in the editor.\n* Zero-sized (\"tag\") enableable components were not always correctly enabled by default, when added to an entire chunk (such as via `EntityManager.AddComponent<EnableableTag>(query)`).\n* Fixed issue with DotsGlobalSettings reporting the incorrect PlayType when switching from DedicatedServer to another standalone build target.\n* Fixed TypeManager initialization causing a crash in the Entities Hierarchy.\n* If you schedule an `IJobEntity` instance with a custom query that doesn't contain the components required for the `Execute()` method to run, a readable and actionable runtime exception is now thrown when safety checks are enabled.\n* `EntityCommandBuffer.Dispose()` can no longer trigger a stack overflow when disposing large command buffers.\n* Throw a readable, actionable compile-time error informing users that `RefRO<T>`, `RefRW<T>`, `EnabledRefRO<T>`,  `EnabledRefRW<T>`, `DynamicBuffer<T>` and `UnityEngineComponent<T>` may not be used with generic types.\n* A `foreach` iterating over an `EntityQuery` with enableable components now iterates over the correct entities.\n* Re-added obsolete baker functions\n* The accidental exposure of package internals to \"Assembly-CSharp\" was reverted.\n* Default the build system to use the client settings if the package com.unity.netcode is not installed when the active  platform is dedicated server.\n* `Entities.WithStructuralChanges().ForEach()` now correctly handles enableable components.\n* Allow components to contain nested native containers. Previously the TypeManager would throw during initialization if a component contained a a nested NativeContainer field. Note: NativeContainers still cannot be verified to be safely accessed when used in jobs. So, if a component contains a nested NativeContainer field, that component can only be accessed from the main thread.\n* Entities Hierarchy correctly selects the subscenes\n* Invalid entity warning in Inspector window with runtime data mode is only applied to entities or game objects that can be converted to entities.\n* Issue with IJobEntity source-generators not getting re-run in IDE. This could cause Rider and Visual Studio to not be able to find/debug generated code for IJobEntity types.\n* Adding managed components to entities via an `EntityCommandBuffer` on the main thread no longer triggers the `NullReferenceException`.\n* Fixed an issue where entities with enableable components loaded from a subscene could reference the wrong component's enabled/disabled state.\n* Fixed an issue where idiomatic foreach (IFE) would not iterate over all entities that matched its query, if the query contains enableable components\n* Issue where recompilation would retrigger baking unnecessarily."

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Added `RegisterBindingAttribute(string authoringField, Type runtimeComponent, string runtimeField)` to provide better control when registering nested types in authoring components.\n* RuntimeContentSystem.LoadContentCatalog allows for starting the content delivery and update process when ENABLE_CONTENT_DELIVERY is defined.   The automatic update is no longer triggered when the applications starts.\n* Streaming samples.\n* RemoteContentCatalogBuildUtility.BuildContent helper method added to allow building player content without having to rebuild the player.  This is needed in order for developers to create their own publishing workflow for remote content delivery.\n* Added missing SceneSystem.UnloadScene prototype.\n* Generic IJobEntity jobs are not yet supported.  Added a proper error to indicate this instead of a compiler error.\n* SceneSystem.UnloadScene(WorldUnmanaged world, Entity sceneEntity, bool fullyUnload)\n* `ManagedAPI.GetComponentTypeHandle` now let's you get a typehandle to `Class IComponentData`.\n* Baking systems from the excluded baking assemblies are also filtered out during baking.\n* Two new categories of component types can be provided when creating an `EntityQuery`. Components in the `Disabled` list must be present on matching entities, but must be disabled. `Components in the `Absent` list must not be on the entity at all.\n* Companion objects need to always instantiate since the content manager reuses loaded objects.\n* A new WorldSystemFilterFlags called Streaming to identify all the systems involved in streaming.\n* Add AlwaysIncludeBakingSystem internal attribute to run baking systems from excluded baking assemblies\n* WorldSystemFilter to the runtime version of ResolveSceneReferenceSystem.\n* DependsOnLightBaking can be called from bakers to register a dependency against light mapping data.\n* Added support for managed (shared) components serialization in DOTS runtime.\n* debug only check to prevent disposal of blob assets managed by a blob asset store.\n\n### Changed\n\n* `ComponentTypeHandle` and `BufferTypeHandle` now more consistently use their cache of per-archetype metadata to accelerate common operations like `.Has<T>()`, `.DidChange<T>()` and `.GetNativeArray<T>()`.\n* `ComponentLookup` and `BufferLookup` now more consistently use their cache of per-archetype metadata to accelerate common operations like `.HasComponent<T>()`, `.IsComponentEnabled<T>()` and `.SetComponentEnabled<T>()`.\n* Upgraded to use Roslyn 4.0.1\n* Added better support for vector type fields in `BindingRegistry`.\n* Unmanaged shared components are serialized as blittable data.\n* `ISystem` now doesn't need `BurstCompile` on the struct. Thus bursting a system simply means to put BurstCompile on either `OnCreate`, `OnStartRunning`, `OnUpdate`, `OnStopRunning`, or `OnDestroy`.\n* The \"a system could not be added to group\" error message now contains the name of the World affected for easier debugging\n* Nested native containers are protected against in any type attributed with [NativeContainer]\n* Unmanaged shared components are no longer boxed when collecting BlobAssetReferences.\n* EditorEntityScenes.GetSubScenes was made public in order to gather subscenes to pass to the BuildContent API.\n* `EntityManager.GetAllUniqueSharedComponents` now takes an `AllocatorManager.AllocatorHandle` instead of an `Allocator` enum parameter allowing for custom allocators to be used when allocating the `NativeList<T>` return value. `Allocator` implicitly converts to `AllocatorManager.AllocatorHandle` so no action is required to call the changed API.\n* IJobEntity refactored to IncrementalGenerator.\n* IJobEntity now doesn't default to outputting generated files in `Temp/GeneratedCode/***`. To turn it on use `DOTS_OUTPUT_SOURCEGEN_FILES`. Turning it on will cost Compilation Time.\n* Replaced .Name with .FullName for duplicated component message in baking.\n* Removed `IIsFullyUnmanaged` due to obtrusiveness when compilation fails. Instead gives runtime error when incorrectly scheduling managed IJobEntity.\n* ManagedComponents and Shared Managed Components can now be Scheduled in IJobEntity (ScheduleParallel still not allowed. Runtime error will be thrown if you try.)\n* Invalid entities now show their index and version when viewed in the inspector\n* In Bakers AddTransformUsageFlags now takes an entity instead of a GameObject or a Component.\n* Baking log output to be more succinct.\n* In cases where there are no attributes constraining the order of system creation, updating, and destruction, the order will have changed to enable optimizations. If you have mysterious bugs after this update, check for missing [CreateAfter], [CreateBefore], [UpdateAfter], and [UpdateBefore] attributes.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* Deprecated `RegisterBindingAttribute(Type runtimeComponent, string runtimeField, bool generated)`. Vector type fields can now be registered automatically without the `generated` option.\n* SceneSystem.UnloadParameters and SceneSystem.UnloadScene receiving SceneSystem.UnloadParameters as parameters.\n\n### Removed\n\n* SourceGen no longer outputs .cs files in `Temp/GeneratedCode` by default, because most IDEs such as Rider and Visual Studio support SourceGen output. If you want to emit the output (at the cost of significant compilation time), use the `DOTS_OUTPUT_SOURCEGEN_FILES` define.\n* From Unity Editor version 2022.2 and later, the **Auto Generate** mode in the Lighting window is unavailable with the Entities package. This is because when you generate lighting in a project, the Unity Editor opens all loaded subscenes, which might slow down Editor performance. On demand baking is still available and is the recommended way of generating lighting.\n* Tooling to re-write user files to add missing partial keywords to systems.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* A selection issue with keyboard arrow keys in Entities Hierarchy window.\n* GetComponent on Transform triggers now a rebake when the gameobject is reparented.\n* Removed unnecessary test assemblies from always being loaded in projects.\n* In DOTS Runtime, shared components containing managed references could generate incorrect results when calling `TypeManager.Equals` and/or `TypeManager.GetHashCode`. We also now reinforce that all shared components containing managed references must implement `IEquatable<>`\n* Using `EnabledRefRO<T>` and `EnabledRefRW<T>` parameters in `IJobEntity.Execute()` with zero-sized enableable components is now supported.\n* The transform system no longer increments the change version of `WorldTransform` and `LocalToWorld` on all world-space entities every frame. This prevents entity hierarchies from being processed redundantly, even if their root entity had not moved since the last update.\n* Fixes lightmaps for player builds\n* Creating multiple additional entities in a baker now scales linearly\n* Fixed the behavior of EntityRemapUtility.HasEntityReferencesManaged for types where Entity or BlobAsset reference fields are succeeded by two or more strings.\n* Setting a shared component to its default value using an EntityCommandBuffer could cause the default value to be duplicated and this would prevent query filtering from working correctly.\n* Using `EnabledRefXX<T>` and `RefXX<T>` wrappers on the same component in the same `IJobEntity.Execute()` method no longer throws compiler errors.\n* It is now possible to force reimport a single or multiple subscenes from the inspector when the last import of the subscene failed.\n* Fix SubScene issue with File -> Save As when having a SubScene as the Active Scene.\n* `EntityQueryEnumerator.MoveNextEntityRange()` now consistently returns the correct `entityCount` value.\n* IJobEntity compile error when using an aspect's lookup type as field.\n* Invalid subscene nodes issues in Entities Hierarchy window.\n* Some `EntityManager` methods (including `RemoveComponent()` were not calling their Burst-compiled implementations.\n* Badly formatted error messages when they are emitted while in burst-compiled code.\n* Performance issue in Entities Hierarchy when opening large subscenes.\n* An `EntityCommandBuffer` containing references to managed components will no longer throw an exception if it is disposed from a Burst-compiled context.\n* Errors for DynamicSharedComponentTypeHandle were reporting as DynamicComponentTypeHandle\n* Entities Hierarchy reset properly after test runner execution.\n* Fixed a small memory leak that would occur when calling `EntityManager.GetAllUniqueSharedComponents` with an `unmanaged` component `T` type.\n* Improve subscene handling in Entities Hierarchy\n* Stack overflow in source generators when IComponentData has a cycle.\n* Fix a NullReferenceException happening in the BakingFilterSettings when an assembly definition added in the excluded list of baking assemblies is missing.\n* First cross reference to section 0 being lost.\n* Fix missing subscene sections to load and unload from the subscene inspector.\n* Aspect generator cache flush. Nested aspects no longer cause compilation error when their fields are changed.\n* Added implicit dependency on transform hierarchy for transform bakers.\n* Section 0 unloading is delayed until all the other sections are unloaded.\n* Loading scene sections with `BlockOnStreamIn` failed if section 0 wasn't loaded first.\n* Components window's list view item height is fixed to the correct value.\n* IJobEntityChunkBeginEnd now doesn't update change version if `shouldExecuteChunk` is false.\n* The detection of duplicate components during baking was failing between different baking passes.\n* Issue with types used in codegen not being found if there if they exist in a more namespace name that aliases with a more immediate namespace name.\n* The following `ArchetypeChunk` methods may now be invoked on zero-sized components without triggering any exception: `GetNativeArray<T>(ref ComponentTypeHandle<T> typeHandle)`, `GetComponentDataPtrRO<T>(ref ComponentTypeHandle<T> typeHandle)`, `GetComponentDataPtrRW<T>(ref ComponentTypeHandle<T> typeHandle)`, `GetRequiredComponentDataPtrRO<T>(ref ComponentTypeHandle<T> typeHandle)`, and `GetRequiredComponentDataPtrRW<T>(ref ComponentTypeHandle<T> typeHandle)`.\n* Companion components with RequireComponent attributes used to potentially throw an exception during baking when a subset of those components was disabled. (e.g. this was the case with Lights)\n* When multiple blob assets are recreated during baking and happen to recycle the same addresses and same hashes (but not the same hash for the same address), it would confuse the differ that patches the main ECS world with the results of live baking. This problematic configuration has been identified and fixed.\n* Dependency.Complete() not working in systems' OnStartRunning and OnStopRunning\n* Removed redundant dependency on the first transform of the hierarchy in baking.\n* Crash when building a Dedicated Server and Netcode package not present.\n* ComponentSystemGroup.SortSystems() taking many milliseconds for large number of systems.\n* Fixed some spacing issues in the Entity inspector.\n* `EntityManager.RemoveComponent(Entity, ComponentTypeSet)` and `EntityCommandBuffer.RemoveComponent(Entity, ComponentTypeSet)` no longer throw an exception if the target entity is invalid, for consistency with other RemoveComponent functions.\n* Entities Hierarchy: Potential crash caused by race condition when gathering the changes to update the Entities Hierarchy.\n* Entities Hierarchy potential crash when receiving GameObjects' OrderChanged events out of order.\n* entities structural changes profiler module should no longer cause memory corruption (and crash) when recording from jobs using exclusive entity transactions.\n* The number for buffer count in Entity Inspector is not cut anymore.\n* Primary entity is secured to be the first to show in the Preview window.\n* Potentially incorrect remapping of references when using BlobBuilder to create large blobs. This would lead to corrupted blob data in rare cases."

Rather than creating new type handles every frame in `OnUpdate()`, it is more efficient to create the handle once in a system's `OnCreate()`, cache it as a member on the system, and call its `.Update()` method from `OnUpdate()` before using the handle.\n* SystemBase.GetEntityQuery can now take an EntityQueryDescBuilder."
