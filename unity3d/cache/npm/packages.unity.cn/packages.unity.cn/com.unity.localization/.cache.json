This enables you to import and export data using custom settings configured through the CSV Extensions on the collection. (LOC-1130)\n- Added 'Open(Merge)` and `Import(Merge)' options to the CSV Extension property drawer. (LOC-1130)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Upgraded to Addressables 1.22.2. (LOC-1125)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Added \"None\" option to localized string and asset picker. ([LOC-1141](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1141))\n- Added support for tracking UGUI Layout Groups via property variants so the layout updates when a locale is changed. This will require re-adding the GameObjectLocalizer as we do not currently have a way to update existing trackers to the new type. ([LOC-1128](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1128))\n- Fixed `LocalizationSettings.ProjectLocale` being null when the available locales are not initialized. ([LOC-1139](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1139))\n- Fixed `MetadataType.All` not including `AllSharedTableEntries` and `LocalizationSettings`. ([LOC-1131](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1131))\n- Fixed `StackOverflowException` when two locales use each other as fallbacks and Preload Behavior is set to Preload Selected Locale And Fallbacks. ([LOC-1119](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1119))\n- Fixed an issue where we would parse strings that were not marked as smart. ([LOC-1156](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1156))\n- Fixed being able to create cyclic locale fallbacks through the editor. (LOC-1117)\n- Fixed TrackedTransform so it correctly applies the locale position and rotation to a tracked GameObject.

The search provider will now start in visual query builder mode and the Inspector panel is now disabled, it was not used.\n- Removed the Locale Source option from the **Locale Generator** window.\n- Renamed **Locale Generator** to **Add Locale** in Localization Settings.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- A locale change event is no longer sent in playmode when a change is detected to the localization tables. This is now only done in edit mode when previewing a locale via the localization scene controls. ([LOC-1025](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1025))\n- Fixed incorrect calculation of string table row height in the Table window. ([LOC-1058](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1058))\n- Improved handling of dependency operations that may be released after execution. The localization initialization operation will no longer fail during WaitForCompletion when the addressable initialization operation is automatically released. ([LOC-1039](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1039))\n- Improved null handling of `TrackedProperties` values when something went wrong during serialization.\n- We now fail the initialization operation if one of the sub-operations fails.

([LOC-976](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-976))\n- Fixed compilation errors when using Addressables 2.0.0.\n- Fixed Create Table window controls being hidden when a large number of locales were in the project,.

This is due to a bug in Addressables (ADDR-2521). This fix will be re-enabled in the future. (LOC-704)\n- Updated dependency `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` to 2.0.2.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `NullReferenceException` when creating a new table that takes name from renamed table. ([LOC-550](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-creating-a-table-that-takes-name-from-renamed-table))\n- Fixed `GameObjectLocalizer` failing to apply local asset references in Unity versions before 2022.2. ([LOC-714](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-714))\n- Fixed `LocalizedStringTable` and `LocalizedAssetTable` property drawer not setting `GUI.changed` when the reference was changed.

This can be used as an alternative to the **Track Changes** option to manually add the property as a **Localized Property Variant**. The menu item **Remove Localized Property** removes properties. The menu item **Remove Localized Property Variant** removes a specific selected Locale's override. (LOC-358)\n- Added `RemoveTrackedProperty` to `TrackedObject`.\n- Added support to handle a locale that has multiple fallbacks defined. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))\n\n### Changed\n\n- Localized string and asset variants that are empty (no table or entry set) will no longer produce errors and will be ignored.\n- Replaced the `Locale Code` field in the Pseudo localization editor with a `Source Locale` field that only lets you select a locale in the project. (LOC-611)\n- Updated to Addressables `1.19.19`.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Replaced `Locale.GetFallback` with `Locale.GetFallbacks` in order to support multiple fallbacks per locale. ([LOC-607](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-607))\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `LocalesProvider.AddLocale` ignoring the locale being added when a potential fallback was already in the provider.\n- Fixed `LocalizedDatabase.GetTableAsync` creating a new operation each time when requesting a table that had not yet loaded. This would consume more memory than was necessary.\n- Fixed `LocalizedString` and `LocalizedAsset` not showing prefab overrides in the Inspector. (LOC-592)\n- Fixed `NullReferenceException` being thrown when applying property variants and the project locale was null. ([LOC-601](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/errors-are-thrown-in-play-mode-when-project-locale-identifier-is-not-set-in-localization-settings))\n- Fixed bug where calling `RefreshString`, when the loading operation had not completed, would cause `RefreshString` to execute twice.\n- Fixed build failures on Android Platform when System Language is used as Locale Source for Chinese (Simplified) & Chinese (Traditional). (LOC-681)\n- Fixed console errors and warnings when making changes in the Inspector and the project was not configured for localization.\n- Fixed duplicating of Addressable assets when importing a project with no library folder. (LOC-400)\n- Fixed errors when trying to create a table in the Packages directory. ([LOC-614](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/localization-assets-cannot-be-created-inside-embedded-packages))\n- Fixed fallback not working when the fallback had a missing table.\n- Fixed operations being released immediately in edit mode, this could cause data to be lost too soon. ([LOC-667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getlocalizedstring-returns-null-when-the-editor-is-not-in-play-mode))\n- Fixed operations sometimes being released too soon, which could cause them to be released before the yield on the operation had executed.\n- Fixed Psuedo locale editor using the incorrect field for the locale name.\n- Fixed Unity freezing when calling `WaitForCompletion` on a string operation that threw an exception during formatting. (LOC-630)\n- Improved automatic releasing of operations so that we no longer use `CompletedTypeless`, which generates GC.\n- Improved memory management to reduce the amount of garbage being generated by internal operations and adding/removing events. (LOC-571)\n- Reduced allocations when applying Localized Property variants and the string/asset operation was still loading. (LOC-480)"

Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.\n• Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.\n• Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.\n• Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.",
