By default such fields are only considered when they are found on types in the `Unity.Entites` namespace, which helps analyse DOTS and Entities usage of unmanaged memory. Turning this option on can improve reference discovery for native memory, but can also produce false positives and slow down snapshot opening times. If you want to make your own usages of memory allocated vie `UnsafeUtility` easier, it is recommended to instead store references to it as actual pointers or `IntPtr`s.\n\n### Fixed\n- Compilation issues on Unity versions between 6000.0.0a1 and 6000.0.52f1.\n- UI issues due to too long paths and resulting failures to import the files.\n- Fixed potential duplicates in Unity Objects table not finding potential duplicates if their resident memory size differs ([PROFB-367](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-367)).\n- Fixed discrepancies in the resident amounts given for native and managed memory on the Summary page compared to the All Of Memmory Page when inspecting captures from IL2CPP. The resident amounts used for the VM memory where not properly reattributed.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved the analysis of managed data to find DOTS/Entites related references to unmanaged memory when that memory is referenced from types in the `Unity.Entites` namespace.\n- Switched on resident memory breakdown for the managed memory section on the Summary page."

This should make correlating snapshots to timing captures easier. The time reflects the start of the capture taking process and the metadata can be observed by hovering the snapshot in the list of captures (while not in Play Mode).\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed loading of a capture with an invalid native root allocation reference from a graphics resource ([PROFB-359](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-359)).\n- Fixed an issue where the list of snapshots would jump to the wrong position after opening one.\n- Fixed issue where non-Latin characters in a project's Product Name would result in an incorrectly named memory snapshot file ([PROFB-346](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-346)).\n- Fixed case where it was possible to rename a snapshot to an empty string.\n- Fixed SnapshotDataService leaking when opening and closing the Memory Profiler window.\n- Fixed repeated references via multiple fields on the same object leading to a status of \"Bug! Liveness Reason Unknown\" on the referenced object ([PROFB-351](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-351)).\n- Fixed an issue where managed references to smaller native alloctions (<16B), e.g. for NativeArrays, would not be found and listed in the References To or Managed Fields list, instead refering to a reference to a Native Region ([PROFB-353](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-353)).\n- Reattributed PlayStation 5's GPU memory from Native to Graphics in the Summary view and All Of Memory table.\n- Fixed inclusion of allocated GPU memory on the PlayStation 5 on the All Of Memory table under `Native > Unity Subsystem > Unknown`. Instead, it is now shown under `Graphics (Estimated)` and/or `Untracked > Graphics`.\n- Fixed icon for captures made on Apple Vision Pro.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved the handling of exceptions thrown during a snapshot opening process so that previously opened snapshots apear properly as closed int UI and a mismatch between UI and loading state do not lead to follow on-exceptions.\n- Improved the documentation for [`Unity.MemoryProfiler.MetadataCollect`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.memoryprofiler@1.1/api/Unity.MemoryProfiler.MetadataCollect.html).\n- Added GCHandles allocated for managed objects to the list of references if they are not associated with a native object (where that native object would then be placed in the references list).\n- Clarified that the option to break down reserved memory only affects reserved native memory to avoid confusion ([PROFB-369](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-369))."

Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all references to these allocations, as stack variables could reference them as well but are not part of the snapshot. Thus, a native allocation without references is not necessarily leaked.\n- Native Allocations (e.g. those listed in `Native > Unity Subsystems > UnsafeUtility` in the All Of Memory table) are now named based on the field and object information of the first managed reference to them, making them easier to parse than address values and stand out from the list as having reference information.\n\n### Fixed\n- The Boehm GC treats any pointer sized field as potential managed pointer. So far the Memory Profiler only examined reference fields to find referenced objects (outside of those directly held by static fields or GCHandles). The Memory Profiler does not yet follow this logic as it would end up finding invalid Managed objects, but it now finds references from unsafe pointer fields to Managed Objects that are also held by a GC Handle.\n- The Managed Fields table now shows any pointer sized fields that might be holding managed objects as referencing these managed objects (Note: if they are not referenced otherwise, they won't sho up in the other tables).\n\n### Changed\n- The References To table now shows field information for references held by managed fields"

This trimming falsely assumed proper memory region reporting.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved object size information in selection details view; now lists Graphics memory.\n- Showing Graphics sizes in All Of Memory table for snapshots of Unity versions prior to 2022.2 and adjusting native sizes to rely on Profiler.GetRuntimeMemorySizeLong data for these captures.\n- Switched Unity Objects table and summary to use the explicitly reported graphics sizes for all snapshots taken from 2022.2 or newer, instead of 2023.1 or newer. 2022.2 and 2022.3 had this data but was displaying graphics sizes based on calculations using Profiler.GetRuntimeMemorySizeLong data. Earlier 2022.2 and 2022.3 versions had different bugs in the reported values for the explicitly reported graphics sizes so snapshots taken between version 2022.2.0a8 and 2022.3.7f1 might have shown different graphics and native sizes on the Unity Objects table vs what the All Of Memory table was showing for them. Small discrepancies in native memory reporting, that also might have had an influence on the graphics and native sizes shown in the two tables have been fixed in 2022.3.43f1 so for the most reliable data, use that or a newer version for profiling.\n- Grouping all `Graphics > <No Name>` entries into one. If you have these, please update to at least Unity patch version: 2022.3.44f1 or 6000.0.0b16\n- Improved the documentation for `MetadataCollect` API.\n- Opening the Memory Profiler window no longer starts indexing the `assets` search provider by default, leading to potential crashes."

Custom set storage paths will still not be created as issues with these need user input to get resolved properly.\n- Fixed an ArgumentOutOfRangeException in ManagedObjectInspector on selecting some object entries in the All of Memory and Unity Objects table. The field inspector UI was trying to display the managed field values of static fields that hadn't been initialized.\n- Fixed Snapshot opening triggering a synchronous search via SearchService to initialize it for the Select, Find and Asset Preview functionality. As that could trigger SearchService to start indexing, this might have lead to longer stalls on opening snapshots.\n- Fixed string rendering when strings included the ´\\r´ character ([PROFB-113](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-113)).\n- Fixed a crash on opening snapshots with very large managed memory usage ([PROFB-156](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-156)).\n- Fixed messaging for resident memory breakdown data availability. Detailed resident memory breakdown data is available for snapshots taken from Unity versions 2023.1 or newer.\n- Fixed the Unity Object and All Of Memory table UI so that the table mode dropdown does not disappear in a narrow window size. ([PROFB-110](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-110))\n- Disabled resident memory visualization in \"Unity Objects\" and \"All of Memory\" tables for WebGL platform. WebGL doesn't provide residency status.\n- Fixed bug that detailed information isn't showed for graphics resources.\n- Fixed a bug when you can't switch snapshot if snapshot was previously open in compare mode.\n- Fixed a managed memory leak in the Memory Profiler Module UI that the package inserts into the Profiler Window ([PROFB-160](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-160)). Also reduced the impact of a Mesh memory leak caused by UI TK ([UUM-46520](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-46520)).\n- Fixed the display of the memory usage bar diagrams in the Memory Profiler Module UI that the package inserts into the Profiler Window ([PRFOB-165](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-165)).\n- Fixed issue with Unity Objects view that caused some managed objects not to group and shown as separate items.\n\n### Changed\n- Documentation updated.\n- The \"Search In Project\" button now searches in the Assets folder _and_ in Packages (related to ([PROFB-54](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-54))).\n- Improved the performance of selecting items in the All Of Memory and Unity Objects tables for objects with managed memory. This affected in particular objects which have a lot of entries (their own or nested fields) displayed in their Managed Fields in the Selection Details panel. Beyond improving the performance in general, 'Continue...' entries, which can be clicked to get further entries added to the view, now not only appear in fields 4 layers down and for big arrays, but also after a total of 1000 field entries have been added to the view."

Strings and char arrays additionally show their first characters after their address value. Entries for Unity Objects that had their native object destroyed further get the postfix \"(Leaked Shell)\" after their address.\n- Changed Unity Object comparison for same session comparisons to further distinguish Unity Objects by their Instance IDs, unless the table is flattened.\n- Improved Preview, Search and Select In Editor functionality, especially for Scene Objects.\n- Objects of types inheriting from MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject are now grouped under their managed type name in the Unity Objects table.\n\n### Fixed\n- General layout improvements in details view.\n- Fixed missing allocators information in Native->Reserved breakdown in compare mode of the All of Memory view.\n- Fixed Managed Fields table to show details for struct data.\n- Searching the tables now correctly finds items by their type name or overarching group name.\n- Fixed Exceptions when opening snapshots with a managed heap bigger than 2 GB and contiguous managed heap sections bigger than 2 GB ([PROFB-41](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-41)).\n- Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException when selecting Managed Type groups in the All Of Memory table if all instances are Leaked Shell objects.\n- Fixed a bug where the Select In Editor button was available, even though the selected object did not clearly refer to one particular item.

This reduces time to open Tree Map by 25%.\n- Remove reflection usage for opening the Preferences window focused on the Memory Profiler's settings.\n- Renamed \"Top Issues\" to \"Potential Capture Issues\".\n- Adjusted the colors of the bar diagrams in the Memory Usage Overview foldout to improve their readability and clarity.\n- Adjusted Engine and Editor API usage to reflect Memory Profiler APIs moving out of Experimental namespaces in 2022.2.0a13.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed View History buttons from the toolbar.
