        "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added `AsNativeArray()` read‑only accessor to `NetworkList<T>` (#3567)\n- Added serializer for `Pose` (#3546)\n- Added `AttachableBehaviour` helper component to provide an alternate approach to parenting items without using the `NetworkObject` parenting. (#3518)\n- Added `AttachableNode` helper component that is used by `AttachableBehaviour` as the target node for parenting. (#3518)\n- Added `ComponentController` helper component that can be used to synchronize the enabling and disabling of components and can be used in conjunction with `AttachableBehaviour`. (#3518)\n- Added `NetworkBehaviour.OnNetworkPreDespawn` that is invoked before running through the despawn sequence for the `NetworkObject` and all NetworkBehaviour children of the `NetworkObject` being despawned. (#3518)\n- Added methods `GetDefaultNetworkSettings` and `GetDefaultPipelineConfigurations` to `UnityTransport`. These can be used to retrieve the default settings and pipeline stages that are used by `UnityTransport`. This is useful when providing a custom driver constructor through `UnityTransport.s_DriverConstructor`, since it allows reusing or tuning the existing configuration instead of trying to recreate it. This means a transport with a custom driver can now easily benefit from most of the features of `UnityTransport`, like integration with the Network Simulator and Network Profiler from the multiplayer tools package. (#3501)\n- Added mappings between `ClientId` and `TransportId`. (#3516)\n- Added `NetworkPrefabInstanceHandlerWithData<T>`, a variant of `INetworkPrefabInstanceHandler` that provides access to custom instantiation data directly within the `Instantiate()` method. (#3497)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Removed allocation to the heap in NetworkBehaviourUpdate. (#3573)\n- Fixed issue where NetworkConfig.ConnectionData could cause the ConnectionRequestMessage to exceed the transport's MTU size and would result in a buffer overflow error. (#3564)\n- Fixed regression issue in v2.x where `NetworkObject.GetNetworkBehaviourAtOrderIndex` was converted from public to internal. (#3541)\n- Fixed ensuring OnValueChanged callback is still triggered on the authority when a collection changes and then reverts to the previous value in the same frame. (#3539)\n- Fixed synchronizing the destroyGameObject parameter to clients for InScenePlaced network objects. (#3514)\n- Fixed distributed authority related issue where enabling the `NetworkObject.DestroyWithScene` would cause errors when a destroying non-authority instances due to loading (single mode) or unloading scene events. (#3500)\n- Fixed an issue where `UnityTransport` would not accept single words as valid hostnames (notably \"localhost\"). (#3591)\n- Fixed issue where viewing a `NetworkBehaviour` with one or more `NetworkVariable` fields could throw an exception if running a distributed authority network topology with a local (DAHost) host and viewed on the host when the host is not the authority of the associated `NetworkObject`. (#3578)\n- Fixed issue when using a distributed authority network topology and  viewing a `NetworkBehaviour` with one or more `NetworkVariable` fields in the inspector view would not show editable fields. (#3578)\n- Fixed issue with unnecessary internal GC Allocations when using the `IReadOnlyList`  `NetworkManager.ConnectedClientsIds` within a `foreach` statement by either replacing with a `for` loop or directly referencing the `NetworkConnectionManager.ConnectedClientIds`. (#3527)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Marked `UnityTransport.ConnectionAddressData.ServerEndPoint` as obsolete. It can't work when using hostnames as the server address, and its functionality can easily be replicated using `NetworkEndpoint.Parse`. (#3591)\n- Optimized `NetworkList<T>` indexer setter to skip operations when the new value equals the existing value, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary list events and network synchronization.

(#3320)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed memory leaks when domain reload is disabled. (#3428)\n- Fixed issues with the `NetworkBehaviour` and `NetworkVariable` length safety checks. (#3415)\n- Fixed issue where during a `NetworkObject`'s spawn if you instantiated, spawned, and parented another network prefab under the currently spawning `NetworkObject` the parenting message would not properly defer until the parent `NetworkObject` was spawned. (#3403)\n- Fixed issue where in-scene placed `NetworkObjects` could fail to synchronize its transform properly (especially without a `NetworkTransform`) if their parenting changes from the default when the scene is loaded and if the same scene remains loaded between network sessions while the parenting is completely different from the original hierarchy. (#3388)\n- Fixed an issue in `UnityTransport` where the transport would accept sends on invalid connections, leading to a useless memory allocation and confusing error message. (#3383)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` would log an error if there was no destination transition information. (#3384)\n- Fixed initial `NetworkTransform` spawn, ensure it uses world space. (#3361)\n- Fixed issue where `AnticipatedNetworkVariable` previous value returned by `AnticipatedNetworkVariable.OnAuthoritativeValueChanged` is updated correctly on the non-authoritative side. (#3322)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed the scene loading event serialization order for in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s to be based on their parent-child hierarchy. (#3388)"

(#3058)\n- Fixed issue where an exception could occur when receiving a universal RPC for a `NetworkObject` that has been despawned. (#3055)\n- Fixed issue where setting a prefab hash value during connection approval but not having a player prefab assigned could cause an exception when spawning a player. (#3046)\n- Fixed issue where collections v2.2.x was not supported when using UTP v2.2.x within Unity v2022.3. (#3033)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkSpawnManager.HandleNetworkObjectShow` could throw an exception if one of the `NetworkObject` components to show was destroyed during the same frame. (#3029)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkManagerHelper` was continuing to check for hierarchy changes when in play mode. (#3027)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `NetworkVariableDeltaMessage` so the server now forwards delta state updates (owner write permission based from a client) to other clients immediately as opposed to keeping a `NetworkVariable` or `NetworkList` dirty and processing them at the end of the frame or potentially on the next network tick.

(#3081)\n- Fixed issue where applying the position and/or rotation to the `NetworkManager.ConnectionApprovalResponse` when connection approval and auto-spawn player prefab were enabled would not apply the position and/or rotation when the player prefab was instantiated. (#3078)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkObject.SpawnWithObservers` was not being honored when spawning the player prefab. (#3077)\n- Fixed issue with the client count not being correct on the host or server side when a client disconnects itself from a session. (#3075)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `NetworkConfig.AutoSpawnPlayerPrefabClientSide` is no longer automatically set when starting `NetworkManager`. (#3097)\n- Updated `NetworkVariableDeltaMessage` so the server now forwards delta state updates from clients immediately, instead of waiting until the end of the frame or the next network tick.

(#3052)\n- Added message size validation to named and unnamed message sending functions for better error messages. (#3049)\n- Added \"Check for NetworkObject Component\" property to the Multiplayer->Netcode for GameObjects project settings. When disabled, this will bypass the in-editor `NetworkObject` check on `NetworkBehaviour` components. (#3031)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.SwitchTransformSpaceWhenParented` property that, when enabled, will handle the world to local, local to world, and local to local transform space transitions when interpolation is enabled. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.TickSyncChildren` that, when enabled, will tick synchronize nested and/or child `NetworkTransform` components to eliminate any potential visual jittering that could occur if the `NetworkTransform` instances get into a state where their state updates are landing on different network ticks. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkObject.AllowOwnerToParent` property to provide the ability to allow clients to parent owned objects when running in a client-server network topology. (#3013)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SyncOwnerTransformWhenParented` property to provide a way to disable applying the server's transform information in the parenting message on the client owner instance which can be useful for owner authoritative motion models. (#3013)\n- Added `NetcodeEditorBase` editor helper class to provide easier modification and extension of the SDK's components. (#3013)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` would send updates to non-observer clients. (#3057)\n- Fixed issue where an exception could occur when receiving a universal RPC for a `NetworkObject` that has been despawned. (#3052)\n- Fixed issue where a NetworkObject hidden from a client that is then promoted to be session owner was not being synchronized with newly joining clients.(#3051)\n- Fixed issue where clients could have a wrong time delta on `NetworkVariableBase` which could prevent from sending delta state updates. (#3045)\n- Fixed issue where setting a prefab hash value during connection approval but not having a player prefab assigned could cause an exception when spawning a player. (#3042)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkSpawnManager.HandleNetworkObjectShow` could throw an exception if one of the `NetworkObject` components to show was destroyed during the same frame. (#3030)\n- Fixed issue where the `NetworkManagerHelper` was continuing to check for hierarchy changes when in play mode. (#3026)\n- Fixed issue with newly/late joined clients and `NetworkTransform` synchronization of parented `NetworkObject` instances. (#3013)\n- Fixed issue with smooth transitions between transform spaces when interpolation is enabled (requires `NetworkTransform.SwitchTransformSpaceWhenParented` to be enabled). (#3013)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor` now uses `NetworkTransform` as the base type class to assure it doesn't display a foldout group when using the base `NetworkTransform` component class. (#3052)\n- Changed `NetworkAnimator.Awake` is now a protected virtual method. (#3052)\n- Changed  when invoking `NetworkManager.ConnectionManager.DisconnectClient` during a distributed authority session a more appropriate message is logged. (#3052)\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor` so it now derives from `NetcodeEditorBase`. (#3013)\n- Changed `NetworkRigidbodyBaseEditor` so it now derives from `NetcodeEditorBase`.

(#2957)\n- Added `AnticipatedNetworkTransform`, which adds support for client anticipation of NetworkTransforms. (#2957)\n- Added `NetworkVariableBase.ExceedsDirtinessThreshold` to allow network variables to throttle updates by only sending updates when the difference between the current and previous values exceeds a threshold. (This is exposed in `NetworkVariable<T>` with the callback `NetworkVariable<T>.CheckExceedsDirtinessThreshold`). (#2957)\n- Added `NetworkVariableUpdateTraits`, which add additional throttling support: `MinSecondsBetweenUpdates` will prevent the `NetworkVariable` from sending updates more often than the specified time period (even if it exceeds the dirtiness threshold), while `MaxSecondsBetweenUpdates` will force a dirty `NetworkVariable` to send an update after the specified time period even if it has not yet exceeded the dirtiness threshold. (#2957)\n- Added virtual method `NetworkVariableBase.OnInitialize` which can be used by `NetworkVariable` subclasses to add initialization code. (#2957)\n- Added `NetworkTime.TickWithPartial`, which represents the current tick as a double that includes the fractional/partial tick value. (#2957)\n- Added `NetworkTickSystem.AnticipationTick`, which can be helpful with implementation of client anticipation. This value represents the tick the current local client was at at the beginning of the most recent network round trip, which enables it to correlate server update ticks with the client tick that may have triggered them.

(#2957)\n- Changed the client's owned objects is now returned (`NetworkClient` and `NetworkSpawnManager`) as an array as opposed to a list for performance purposes. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransfrom.TryCommitTransformToServer` to be internal as it will be removed by the final 2.0.0 release. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor.OnEnable` to a virtual method to be able to customize a `NetworkTransform` derived class by creating a derived editor control from `NetworkTransformEditor`.

(#2948)\n- Added `NetworkRigidBodyBase.GetAngularVelocity` and `NetworkRigidBodyBase.SetAngularVelocity` convenience/helper methods. (#2948)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue when `NetworkTransform` half float precision is enabled and ownership changes the current base position was not being synchronized. (#2948)\n- Fixed issue where `OnClientConnected` not being invoked on the session owner when connecting to a new distributed authority session. (#2948)\n- Fixed issue where Rigidbody micro-motion (i.e. relatively small velocities) would result in non-authority instances slightly stuttering as the body would come to a rest (i.e. no motion). Now, the threshold value can increase at higher velocities and can decrease slightly below the provided threshold to account for this. (#2948)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed the client's owned objects is now returned (`NetworkClient` and `NetworkSpawnManager`) as an array as opposed to a list for performance purposes. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransfrom.TryCommitTransformToServer` to be internal as it will be removed by the final 2.0.0 release. (#2948)\n- Changed `NetworkTransformEditor.OnEnable` to a virtual method to be able to customize a `NetworkTransform` derived class by creating a derived editor control from `NetworkTransformEditor`.

(This is exposed in NetworkVariable<T> with the callback NetworkVariable<T>.CheckExceedsDirtinessThreshold) (#2820)\n- Added NetworkVariableUpdateTraits, which add additional throttling support: MinSecondsBetweenUpdates will prevent the NetworkVariable from sending updates more often than the specified time period (even if it exceeds the dirtiness threshold), while MaxSecondsBetweenUpdates will force a dirty NetworkVariable to send an update after the specified time period even if it has not yet exceeded the dirtiness threshold. (#2820)\n- Added virtual method NetworkVariableBase.OnInitialize() which can be used by NetworkVariable subclasses to add initialization code (#2820)\n- Added virtual method NetworkVariableBase.Update(), which is called once per frame to support behaviors such as interpolation between an anticipated value and an authoritative one. (#2820)\n- Added NetworkTime.TickWithPartial, which represents the current tick as a double that includes the fractional/partial tick value. (#2820)\n- Added NetworkTickSystem.AnticipationTick, which can be helpful with implementation of client anticipation. This value represents the tick the current local client was at at the beginning of the most recent network round trip, which enables it to correlate server update ticks with the client tick that may have triggered them. (#2820)\n- `NetworkVariable` now includes built-in support for `NativeHashSet`, `NativeHashMap`, `List`, `HashSet`, and `Dictionary` (#2813)\n- `NetworkVariable` now includes delta compression for collection values (`NativeList`, `NativeArray`, `NativeHashSet`, `NativeHashMap`, `List`, `HashSet`, `Dictionary`, and `FixedString` types) to save bandwidth by only sending the values that changed. (Note: For `NativeList`, `NativeArray`, and `List`, this algorithm works differently than that used in `NetworkList`. This algorithm will use less bandwidth for \"set\" and \"add\" operations, but `NetworkList` is more bandwidth-efficient if you are performing frequent \"insert\" operations.) (#2813)\n- `UserNetworkVariableSerialization` now has optional callbacks for `WriteDelta` and `ReadDelta`. If both are provided, they will be used for all serialization operations on NetworkVariables of that type except for the first one for each client. If either is missing, the existing `Write` and `Read` will always be used. (#2813)\n- Network variables wrapping `INetworkSerializable` types can perform delta serialization by setting `UserNetworkVariableSerialization<T>.WriteDelta` and `UserNetworkVariableSerialization<T>.ReadDelta` for those types. The built-in `INetworkSerializable` serializer will continue to be used for all other serialization operations, but if those callbacks are set, it will call into them on all but the initial serialization to perform delta serialization. (This could be useful if you have a large struct where most values do not change regularly and you want to send only the fields that did change.) (#2813)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where NetworkTransformEditor would throw and exception if you excluded the physics package. (#2871)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` could not properly synchronize its base position when using half float precision. (#2845)\n- Fixed issue where the host was not invoking `OnClientDisconnectCallback` for its own local client when internally shutting down.

(#2807)\n- Fixed issue where in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s with complex nested children `NetworkObject`s (more than one child in depth) would not synchronize properly if WorldPositionStays was set to true.

(#2872)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` to now use `NetworkTransformMessage` as opposed to named messages for NetworkTransformState updates. (#2810)\n- Changed `CustomMessageManager` so it no longer attempts to register or \"unregister\" a null or empty string and will log an error if this condition occurs. (#2807)"

(#2863)\n- Added `NetworkRigidbodyBase` that provides users with a more customizable network rigidbody, handles both `Rigidbody` and `Rigidbody2D`, and provides an option to make `NetworkTransform` use the rigid body for motion.  (#2863)\n  - For a customized `NetworkRigidbodyBase` class:\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.AutoUpdateKinematicState` provides control on whether the kinematic setting will be automatically set or not when ownership changes.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.AutoSetKinematicOnDespawn` provides control on whether isKinematic will automatically be set to true when the associated `NetworkObject` is despawned.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.Initialize` is a protected method that, when invoked, will initialize the instance. This includes options to:\n      - Set whether using a `RigidbodyTypes.Rigidbody` or `RigidbodyTypes.Rigidbody2D`.\n      - Includes additional optional parameters to set the `NetworkTransform`, `Rigidbody`, and `Rigidbody2d` to use.\n  - Provides additional public methods:\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.GetPosition` to return the position of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.GetRotation` to return the rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.MovePosition` to move to the position of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.MoveRotation` to move to the rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.Move` to move to the position and rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.Move` to move to the position and rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.SetPosition` to set the position of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.SetRotation` to set the rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.ApplyCurrentTransform` to set the position and rotation of the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` based on the associated `GameObject` transform (depending upon its initialized setting).\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.WakeIfSleeping` to wake up the rigid body if sleeping.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.SleepRigidbody` to put the rigid body to sleep.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.IsKinematic` to determine if the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting) is currently kinematic.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.SetIsKinematic` to set the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting) current kinematic state.\n    - `NetworkRigidbodyBase.ResetInterpolation` to reset the `Rigidbody` or `Rigidbody2d` (depending upon its initialized setting) back to its original interpolation value when initialized.\n  - Now includes a `MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate` implementation that will update the assigned `NetworkTransform` when `NetworkRigidbodyBase.UseRigidBodyForMotion` is true. (#2863)\n- Added `RigidbodyContactEventManager` that provides a more optimized way to process collision enter and collision stay events as opposed to the `Monobehaviour` approach. (#2863)\n  - Can be used in client-server and distributed authority modes, but is particularly useful in distributed authority.\n- Added rigid body motion updates to `NetworkTransform` which allows users to set interolation on rigid bodies. (#2863)\n  - Extrapolation is only allowed on authoritative instances, but custom class derived from `NetworkRigidbodyBase` or `NetworkRigidbody` or `NetworkRigidbody2D` automatically switches non-authoritative instances to interpolation if set to extrapolation.\n- Added distributed authority mode support to `NetworkAnimator`. (#2863)\n- Added session mode selection to `NetworkManager` inspector view. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority permissions feature. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject` permissions flags (Distributable, Transferable, and RequestRequired). (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.SetOwnershipStatus` method that applies one or more `NetworkObject` instance's ownership flags. If updated when spawned, the ownership permission changes are synchronized with the other connected clients. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.RemoveOwnershipStatus` method that removes one or more `NetworkObject` instance's ownership flags. If updated when spawned, the ownership permission changes are synchronized with the other connected clients. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.HasOwnershipStatus` method that will return (true or false) whether one or more ownership flags is set. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.SetOwnershipLock` method that locks ownership of a `NetworkObject` to prevent ownership from changing until the current owner releases the lock. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.RequestOwnership` method that sends an ownership request to the current owner of a spawned `NetworkObject` instance. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.OnOwnershipRequested` callback handler that is invoked on the owner/authoritative side when a non-owner requests ownership. Depending upon the boolean returned value depends upon whether the request is approved or denied. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.OnOwnershipRequestResponse` callback handler that is invoked when a non-owner's request has been processed. This callback includes a `NetworkObjet.OwnershipRequestResponseStatus` response parameter that describes whether the request was approved or the reason why it was not approved. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.DeferDespawn` method that defers the despawning of `NetworkObject` instances on non-authoritative clients based on the tick offset parameter. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkObject.OnDeferredDespawnComplete` callback handler that can be used to further control when deferring the despawning of a `NetworkObject` on non-authoritative instances. (#2863)\n- Added `NetworkClient.SessionModeType` as one way to determine the current session mode of the network session a client is connected to. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkClient.IsSessionOwner` property to determine if the current local client is the current session owner of a distributed authority session. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific client side spawning capabilities. When running in distributed authority mode, clients can instantiate and spawn `NetworkObject` instances (the local client is authomatically the owner of the spawned object). (#2863)\n  - This is useful to better visually synchronize owner authoritative motion models and newly spawned `NetworkObject` instances (i.e. projectiles for example).\n- Added distributed authority mode specific client side player spawning capabilities. Clients will automatically spawn their associated player object locally. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkConfig.AutoSpawnPlayerPrefabClientSide` property (default is true) to provide control over the automatic spawning of player prefabs on the local client side. (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkManager.OnFetchLocalPlayerPrefabToSpawn` callback that, when assigned, will allow the local client to provide the player prefab to be spawned for the local client. (#2863)\n  - This is only invoked if the `NetworkConfig.AutoSpawnPlayerPrefabClientSide` property is set to true.\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkBehaviour.HasAuthority` property that determines if the local client has authority over the associated `NetworkObject` instance (typical use case is within a `NetworkBehaviour` script much like that of `IsServer` or `IsClient`). (#2863)\n- Added distributed authority mode specific `NetworkBehaviour.IsSessionOwner` property that determines if the local client is the session owner (typical use case would be to determine if the local client can has scene management authority within a `NetworkBehaviour` script). (#2863)\n- Added support for distributed authority mode scene management where the currently assigned session owner can start scene events (i.e. scene loading and scene unloading). (#2863)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where the host was not invoking `OnClientDisconnectCallback` for its own local client when internally shutting down. (#2822)\n- Fixed issue where NetworkTransform could potentially attempt to \"unregister\" a named message prior to it being registered.

(#2796)\n\n### Changed\n- Changed client side awareness of other clients is now the same as a server or host. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkManager.ConnectedClients` can now be accessed by both server and clients. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkManager.ConnectedClientsList` can now be accessed by both server and clients. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` defaults to owner authoritative when connected to a distributed authority session. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkVariable` defaults to owner write and everyone read permissions when connected to a distributed authority session (even if declared with server read or write permissions).  (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkObject` no longer implements the `MonoBehaviour.Update` method in order to determine whether a `NetworkObject` instance has been migrated to a different scene. Instead, only `NetworkObjects` with the `SceneMigrationSynchronization` property set will be updated internally during the `NetworkUpdateStage.PostLateUpdate` by `NetworkManager`. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkManager` inspector view layout where properties are now organized by category. (#2863)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` to now use `NetworkTransformMessage` as opposed to named messages for NetworkTransformState updates. (#2810)\n- Changed `CustomMessageManager` so it no longer attempts to register or \"unregister\" a null or empty string and will log an error if this condition occurs. (#2807)"

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added a new RPC attribute, which is simply `Rpc`. (#2762)\n  - This is a generic attribute that can perform the functions of both Server and Client RPCs, as well as enabling client-to-client RPCs. Includes several default targets: `Server`, `NotServer`, `Owner`, `NotOwner`, `Me`, `NotMe`, `ClientsAndHost`, and `Everyone`. Runtime overrides are available for any of these targets, as well as for sending to a specific ID or groups of IDs.\n  - This attribute also includes the ability to defer RPCs that are sent to the local process to the start of the next frame instead of executing them immediately, treating them as if they had gone across the network. The default behavior is to execute immediately.\n  - This attribute effectively replaces `ServerRpc` and `ClientRpc`. `ServerRpc` and `ClientRpc` remain in their existing forms for backward compatibility, but `Rpc` will be the recommended and most supported option.\n- Added `NetworkManager.OnConnectionEvent` as a unified connection event callback to notify clients and servers of all client connections and disconnections within the session (#2762)\n- Added `NetworkManager.ServerIsHost` and `NetworkBehaviour.ServerIsHost` to allow a client to tell if it is connected to a host or to a dedicated server (#2762)\n- Added `SceneEventProgress.SceneManagementNotEnabled` return status to be returned when a `NetworkSceneManager` method is invoked and scene management is not enabled. (#2735)\n- Added `SceneEventProgress.ServerOnlyAction` return status to be returned when a `NetworkSceneManager` method is invoked by a client. (#2735)\n- Added `NetworkObject.InstantiateAndSpawn` and `NetworkSpawnManager.InstantiateAndSpawn` methods to simplify prefab spawning by assuring that the prefab is valid and applies any override prior to instantiating the `GameObject` and spawning the `NetworkObject` instance. (#2710)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where a client disconnected by a server-host would not receive a local notification. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where a server-host could shutdown during a relay connection but periodically the transport disconnect message sent to any connected clients could be dropped. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where a host could disconnect its local client but remain running as a server. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where `OnClientDisconnectedCallback` was not being invoked under certain conditions. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where `OnClientDisconnectedCallback` was always returning 0 as the client identifier. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where if a host or server shutdown while a client owned NetworkObjects (other than the player) it would throw an exception. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where setting values on a `NetworkVariable` or `NetworkList` within `OnNetworkDespawn` during a shutdown sequence would throw an exception. (#2789)\n- Fixed issue where a teleport state could potentially be overridden by a previous unreliable delta state. (#2777)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was using the `NetworkManager.ServerTime.Tick` as opposed to `NetworkManager.NetworkTickSystem.ServerTime.Tick` during the authoritative side's tick update where it performed a delta state check. (#2777)\n- Fixed issue where a parented in-scene placed NetworkObject would be destroyed upon a client or server exiting a network session but not unloading the original scene in which the NetworkObject was placed. (#2737)\n- Fixed issue where during client synchronization and scene loading, when client synchronization or the scene loading mode are set to `LoadSceneMode.Single`, a `CreateObjectMessage` could be received, processed, and the resultant spawned `NetworkObject` could be instantiated in the client's currently active scene that could, towards the end of the client synchronization or loading process, be unloaded and cause the newly created `NetworkObject` to be destroyed (and throw and exception). (#2735)\n- Fixed issue where a `NetworkTransform` instance with interpolation enabled would result in wide visual motion gaps (stuttering) under above normal latency conditions and a 1-5% or higher packet are drop rate. (#2713)\n- Fixed issue where  you could not have multiple source network prefab overrides targeting the same network prefab as their override. (#2710)\n\n### Changed\n- Changed the server or host shutdown so it will now perform a \"soft shutdown\" when `NetworkManager.Shutdown` is invoked. This will send a disconnect notification to all connected clients and the server-host will wait for all connected clients to disconnect or timeout after a 5 second period before completing the shutdown process. (#2789)\n- Changed `OnClientDisconnectedCallback` will now return the assigned client identifier on the local client side if the client was approved and assigned one prior to being disconnected. (#2789)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform.SetState` (and related methods) now are cumulative during a fractional tick period and sent on the next pending tick. (#2777)\n- `NetworkManager.ConnectedClientsIds` is now accessible on the client side and will contain the list of all clients in the session, including the host client if the server is operating in host mode (#2762)\n- Changed `NetworkSceneManager` to return a `SceneEventProgress` status and not throw exceptions for methods invoked when scene management is disabled and when a client attempts to access a `NetworkSceneManager` method by a client. (#2735)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` authoritative instance tick registration so a single `NetworkTransform` specific tick event update will update all authoritative instances to improve perofmance. (#2713)\n- Changed `NetworkPrefabs.OverrideToNetworkPrefab` dictionary is no longer used/populated due to it ending up being related to a regression bug and not allowing more than one override to be assigned to a network prefab asset. (#2710)\n- Changed in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s now store their source network prefab asset's `GlobalObjectIdHash` internally that is used, when scene management is disabled, by clients to spawn the correct prefab even if the `NetworkPrefab` entry has an override. This does not impact dynamically spawning the same prefab which will yield the override on both host and client. (#2710)\n- Changed in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s no longer require a `NetworkPrefab` entry with `GlobalObjectIdHash` override in order for clients to properly synchronize. (#2710)\n- Changed in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s now set their `IsSceneObject` value when generating their `GlobalObjectIdHash` value. (#2710)\n- Changed the default `NetworkConfig.SpawnTimeout` value from 1.0s to 10.0s. (#2710)"

(To use `NativeList<>`, add `UNITY_NETCODE_NATIVE_COLLECTION_SUPPORT` to your Scripting Define Symbols in `Project Settings > Player`) (#2375)\n- The location of the automatically-created default network prefab list can now be configured (#2544)\n- Added: Message size limits (max single message and max fragmented message) can now be set using NetworkManager.MaximumTransmissionUnitSize and NetworkManager.MaximumFragmentedMessageSize for transports that don't work with the default values (#2530)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SpawnWithObservers` property (default is true) that when set to false will spawn a `NetworkObject` with no observers and will not be spawned on any client until `NetworkObject.NetworkShow` is invoked. (#2568)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed: Fixed a null reference in codegen in some projects (#2581)\n- Fixed issue where the `OnClientDisconnected` client identifier was incorrect after a pending client connection was denied. (#2569)\n- Fixed warning \"Runtime Network Prefabs was not empty at initialization time.\" being erroneously logged when no runtime network prefabs had been added (#2565)\n- Fixed issue where some temporary debug console logging was left in a merged PR. (#2562)\n- Fixed the \"Generate Default Network Prefabs List\" setting not loading correctly and always reverting to being checked. (#2545)\n- Fixed issue where users could not use NetworkSceneManager.VerifySceneBeforeLoading to exclude runtime generated scenes from client synchronization. (#2550)\n- Fixed missing value on `NetworkListEvent` for `EventType.RemoveAt` events.  (#2542,#2543)\n- Fixed issue where parenting a NetworkTransform under a transform with a scale other than Vector3.one would result in incorrect values on non-authoritative instances. (#2538)\n- Fixed issue where a server would include scene migrated and then despawned NetworkObjects to a client that was being synchronized. (#2532)\n- Fixed the inspector throwing exceptions when attempting to render `NetworkVariable`s of enum types. (#2529)\n- Making a `NetworkVariable` with an `INetworkSerializable` type that doesn't meet the `new()` constraint will now create a compile-time error instead of an editor crash (#2528)\n- Fixed Multiplayer Tools package installation docs page link on the NetworkManager popup. (#2526)\n- Fixed an exception and error logging when two different objects are shown and hidden on the same frame (#2524)\n- Fixed a memory leak in `UnityTransport` that occurred if `StartClient` failed. (#2518)\n- Fixed issue where a client could throw an exception if abruptly disconnected from a network session with one or more spawned `NetworkObject`(s). (#2510)\n- Fixed issue where invalid endpoint addresses were not being detected and returning false from NGO UnityTransport. (#2496)\n- Fixed some errors that could occur if a connection is lost and the loss is detected when attempting to write to the socket. (#2495)\n\n## Changed\n\n- Adding network prefabs before NetworkManager initialization is now supported. (#2565)\n- Connecting clients being synchronized now switch to the server's active scene before spawning and synchronizing NetworkObjects. (#2532)\n- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.3.4. (#2533)\n- Improved performance of NetworkBehaviour initialization by replacing reflection when initializing NetworkVariables with compile-time code generation, which should help reduce hitching during additive scene loads.

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added a way to access the GlobalObjectIdHash via PrefabIdHash for use in the Connection Approval Callback. (#2437)\n- Added `OnServerStarted` and `OnServerStopped` events that will trigger only on the server (or host player) to notify that the server just started or is no longer active (#2420)\n- Added `OnClientStarted` and `OnClientStopped` events that will trigger only on the client (or host player) to notify that the client just started or is no longer active (#2420)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.UseHalfFloatPrecision` property that, when enabled, will use half float values for position, rotation, and scale. This yields a 50% bandwidth savings a the cost of precision. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.UseQuaternionSynchronization` property that, when enabled, will synchronize the entire quaternion. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.UseQuaternionCompression` property that, when enabled, will use a smallest three implementation reducing a full quaternion synchronization update to the size of an unsigned integer. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.SlerpPosition` property that, when enabled along with interpolation being enabled, will interpolate using `Vector3.Slerp`. (#2388)\n- Added `BufferedLinearInterpolatorVector3` that replaces the float version, is now used by `NetworkTransform`, and provides the ability to enable or disable `Slerp`. (#2388)\n- Added `HalfVector3` used for scale when half float precision is enabled. (#2388)\n- Added `HalfVector4` used for rotation when half float precision and quaternion synchronization is enabled. (#2388)\n- Added `HalfVector3DeltaPosition` used for position when half float precision is enabled. This handles loss in position precision by updating only the delta position as opposed to the full position. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.GetSpaceRelativePosition` and `NetworkTransform.GetSpaceRelativeRotation` helper methods to return the proper values depending upon whether local or world space. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.OnAuthorityPushTransformState` virtual method that is invoked just prior to sending the `NetworkTransformState` to non-authoritative instances. This provides users with the ability to obtain more precise delta values for prediction related calculations. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.OnNetworkTransformStateUpdated` virtual method that is invoked just after the authoritative `NetworkTransformState` is applied. This provides users with the ability to obtain more precise delta values for prediction related calculations. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkTransform.OnInitialize`virtual method that is invoked after the `NetworkTransform` has been initialized or re-initialized when ownership changes. This provides for a way to make adjustments when `NetworkTransform` is initialized (i.e. resetting client prediction etc) (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SynchronizeTransform` property (default is true) that provides users with another way to help with bandwidth optimizations where, when set to false, the `NetworkObject`'s associated transform will not be included when spawning and/or synchronizing late joining players. (#2388)\n- Added `NetworkSceneManager.ActiveSceneSynchronizationEnabled` property, disabled by default, that enables client synchronization of server-side active scene changes. (#2383)\n- Added `NetworkObject.ActiveSceneSynchronization`, disabled by default, that will automatically migrate a `NetworkObject` to a newly assigned active scene. (#2383)\n- Added `NetworkObject.SceneMigrationSynchronization`, enabled by default, that will synchronize client(s) when a `NetworkObject` is migrated into a new scene on the server side via `SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene`. (#2383)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Made sure the `CheckObjectVisibility` delegate is checked and applied, upon `NetworkShow` attempt. Found while supporting (#2454), although this is not a fix for this (already fixed) issue. (#2463)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` authority handles delta checks on each new network tick and no longer consumes processing cycles checking for deltas for all frames in-between ticks. (#2388)\n- Changed the `NetworkTransformState` structure is now public and now has public methods that provide access to key properties of the `NetworkTransformState` structure. (#2388)\n- Changed `NetworkTransform` interpolation adjusts its interpolation \"ticks ago\" to be 2 ticks latent if it is owner authoritative and the instance is not the server or 1 tick latent if the instance is the server and/or is server authoritative. (#2388)\n- Updated `NetworkSceneManager` to migrate dynamically spawned `NetworkObject`s with `DestroyWithScene` set to false into the active scene if their current scene is unloaded. (#2383)\n- Updated the server to synchronize its local `NetworkSceneManager.ClientSynchronizationMode` during the initial client synchronization. (#2383)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where during client synchronization the synchronizing client could receive a ObjectSceneChanged message before the client-side NetworkObject instance had been instantiated and spawned. (#2502)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was building client RPC parameters to exclude the host from sending itself messages but was not including it in the ClientRpc parameters. (#2492)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was not properly detecting and synchronizing cross fade initiated transitions. (#2481)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was not properly synchronizing animation state updates. (#2481)\n- Fixed float NetworkVariables not being rendered properly in the inspector of NetworkObjects. (#2441)\n- Fixed an issue where Named Message Handlers could remove themselves causing an exception when the metrics tried to access the name of the message.(#2426)\n- Fixed registry of public `NetworkVariable`s in derived `NetworkBehaviour`s (#2423)\n- Fixed issue where runtime association of `Animator` properties to `AnimationCurve`s would cause `NetworkAnimator` to attempt to update those changes. (#2416)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` would not check if its associated `Animator` was valid during serialization and would spam exceptions in the editor console. (#2416)\n- Fixed issue with a child's rotation rolling over when interpolation is enabled on a `NetworkTransform`. Now using half precision or full quaternion synchronization will always update all axis. (#2388)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not setting the teleport flag when the `NetworkTransform.InLocalSpace` value changed. This issue only impacted `NetworkTransform` when interpolation was enabled. (#2388)\n- Fixed issue when the `NetworkSceneManager.ClientSynchronizationMode` is `LoadSceneMode.Additive` and the server changes the currently active scene prior to a client connecting then upon a client connecting and being synchronized the NetworkSceneManager would clear its internal ScenePlacedObjects list that could already be populated. (#2383)\n- Fixed issue where a client would load duplicate scenes of already preloaded scenes during the initial client synchronization and `NetworkSceneManager.ClientSynchronizationMode` was set to `LoadSceneMode.Additive`.

(#2450)\n- `NetworkShow()` of `NetworkObject`s are delayed until the end of the frame to ensure consistency of delta-driven variables like `NetworkList`.\n- Dirty `NetworkObject` are reset at end-of-frame and not at serialization time.\n- `NetworkHide()` of an object that was just `NetworkShow()`n produces a warning, as remote clients will _not_ get a spawn/despawn pair.\n- Renamed the NetworkTransform.SetState parameter `shouldGhostsInterpolate` to `teleportDisabled` for better clarity of what that parameter does. (#2228)\n- Network prefabs are now stored in a ScriptableObject that can be shared between NetworkManagers, and have been exposed for public access. By default, a Default Prefabs List is created that contains all NetworkObject prefabs in the project, and new NetworkManagers will default to using that unless that option is turned off in the Netcode for GameObjects settings. Existing NetworkManagers will maintain their existing lists, which can be migrated to the new format via a button in their inspector.

(#2398)\n- Fixed issue where a dynamically spawned `NetworkObject` parented under an in-scene placed `NetworkObject` would have its `InScenePlaced` value changed to `true`. This would result in a soft synchronization error for late joining clients. (#2396)\n- Fixed a UTP test that was failing when you install Unity Transport package 2.0.0 or newer. (#2347)\n- Fixed issue where `NetcodeSettingsProvider` would throw an exception in Unity 2020.3.x versions. (#2345)\n- Fixed server side issue where, depending upon component ordering, some NetworkBehaviour components might not have their OnNetworkDespawn method invoked if the client side disconnected. (#2323)\n- Fixed a case where data corruption could occur when using UnityTransport when reaching a certain level of send throughput. (#2332)\n- Fixed an issue in `UnityTransport` where an exception would be thrown if starting a Relay host/server on WebGL. This exception should only be thrown if using direct connections (where WebGL can't act as a host/server). (#2321)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not checking for `AnimatorStateTtansition.destinationStateMachine` and any possible sub-states defined within it. (#2309)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where the host client was receiving the ClientRpc animation updates when the host was the owner.(#2309)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue with using pooled objects and when specific properties are cleaned during despawn and destroy.(#2309)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was checking for animation changes when the associated `NetworkObject` was not spawned.(#2309)\n- Corrected an issue with the documentation for BufferSerializer (#2401)"

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added a new `OnTransportFailure` callback to `NetworkManager`. This callback is invoked when the manager's `NetworkTransport` encounters an unrecoverable error. Transport failures also cause the `NetworkManager` to shut down. Currently, this is only used by `UnityTransport` to signal a timeout of its connection to the Unity Relay servers. (#1994)\n- Added `NetworkEvent.TransportFailure`, which can be used by implementations of `NetworkTransport` to signal to `NetworkManager` that an unrecoverable error was encountered. (#1994)\n- Added test to ensure a warning occurs when nesting NetworkObjects in a NetworkPrefab (#1969)\n- Added `NetworkManager.RemoveNetworkPrefab(...)` to remove a prefab from the prefabs list (#1950)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.1.0. (#2025)\n- (API Breaking) `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is no longer an `event` and will not allow more than 1 handler registered at a time. Also, `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is now a `Func<>` taking `ConnectionApprovalRequest` in and returning `ConnectionApprovalResponse` back out (#1972)\n\n### Removed\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed issue where dynamically spawned `NetworkObject`s could throw an exception if the scene of origin handle was zero (0) and the `NetworkObject` was already spawned. (#2017)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkObject.Observers` was not being cleared when despawned. (#2009)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` could not run in the server authoritative mode. (#2003)\n- Fixed issue where late joining clients would get a soft synchronization error if any in-scene placed NetworkObjects were parented under another `NetworkObject`. (#1985)\n- Fixed issue where `NetworkBehaviourReference` would throw a type cast exception if using `NetworkBehaviourReference.TryGet` and the component type was not found. (#1984)\n- Fixed `NetworkSceneManager` was not sending scene event notifications for the currently active scene and any additively loaded scenes when loading a new scene in `LoadSceneMode.Single` mode. (#1975)\n- Fixed issue where one or more clients disconnecting during a scene event would cause `LoadEventCompleted` or `UnloadEventCompleted` to wait until the `NetworkConfig.LoadSceneTimeOut` period before being triggered. (#1973)\n- Fixed issues when multiple `ConnectionApprovalCallback`s were registered (#1972)\n- Fixed a regression in serialization support: `FixedString`, `Vector2Int`, and `Vector3Int` types can now be used in NetworkVariables and RPCs again without requiring a `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<>` wrapper. (#1961)\n- Fixed generic types that inherit from NetworkBehaviour causing crashes at compile time. (#1976)\n- Fixed endless dialog boxes when adding a `NetworkBehaviour` to a `NetworkManager` or vice-versa. (#1947)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was only synchronizing parameters if the layer or state changed or was transitioning between states. (#1946)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where when it did detect a parameter had changed it would send all parameters as opposed to only the parameters that changed. (#1946)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not always disposing the `NativeArray` that is allocated when spawned. (#1946)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not taking the animation speed or state speed multiplier into consideration. (#1946)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not properly synchronizing late joining clients if they joined while `Animator` was transitioning between states. (#1946)\n- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where the server was not relaying changes to non-owner clients when a client was the owner. (#1946)\n- Fixed issue where the `PacketLoss` metric for tools would return the packet loss over a connection lifetime instead of a single frame. (#2004)"

Structs that are intended to be serialized across the network must add `INetworkSerializeByMemcpy` to the interface list (i.e., `struct Foo : INetworkSerializeByMemcpy`). This interface is empty and just serves to mark the struct as compatible with memcpy serialization. For external structs you can't edit, you can pass them to RPCs by wrapping them in `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<T>`. (#1901)\n\n### Removed\n- Removed `SIPTransport` (#1870)\n\n- Removed `ClientNetworkTransform` from the package samples and moved to Boss Room's Utilities package which can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/blob/main/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/Utilities/Net/ClientAuthority/ClientNetworkTransform.cs).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `NetworkTransform` generating false positive rotation delta checks when rolling over between 0 and 360 degrees. (#1890)\n- Fixed client throwing an exception if it has messages in the outbound queue when processing the `NetworkEvent.Disconnect` event and is using UTP. (#1884)\n- Fixed issue during client synchronization if 'ValidateSceneBeforeLoading' returned false it would halt the client synchronization process resulting in a client that was approved but not synchronized or fully connected with the server. (#1883)\n- Fixed an issue where UNetTransport.StartServer would return success even if the underlying transport failed to start (#854)\n- Passing generic types to RPCs no longer causes a native crash (#1901)\n- Fixed an issue where calling `Shutdown` on a `NetworkManager` that was already shut down would cause an immediate shutdown the next time it was started (basically the fix makes `Shutdown` idempotent).
