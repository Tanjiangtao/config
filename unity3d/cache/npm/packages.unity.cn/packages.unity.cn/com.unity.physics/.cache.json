This can be useful in cases where contacts lead to deep intersections between colliders, consequently causing too aggressive, ejecting motions. The new `Max Dynamic Depenetration Velocity` and `Max Static Depenetration Velocity` properties control the maximum relative velocity that can be produced when separating intersecting dynamic rigid bodies, and the maximum relative velocity that can be produced when separating dynamic rigid bodies intersecting with static rigid bodies, respectively.\n\n### Changed\n\n* The maximum number of phases in the parallel constraint solver was increased from 16 to now 64, leading to significant speed-ups in parallel constraint processing by the `ParallelSolverJob` in situations where the body-constraint graph topology would have caused the graph coloring algorithm to run out of colors (phases). In the latter, all affected constraints were processed in serial at the end of each solver iteration by only a single job worker thread, thereby wasting significant computational resources and causing an unnecessary slowdown in every solver iteration. This is no longer the case with this change. The resultant performance improvement can be observed among others in the `Planet Gravity` sample scene in the `PhysicsSamples` project.\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.23"

To enable the feature select the \"Detailed Static Mesh Collision\" option in the \"Advanced\" section of your custom `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` component, or, If you are using built-in `Collider` components, add the new `DetailedStaticMeshCollisionAuthoring` component alongside your collider. For runtime-generated colliders, please use the `EnableDetailedStaticMeshCollision` parameter in the physics material.\n* Integrity checks for incremental broadphase. When integrity checks are enabled (see Project Settings -> Physics -> Unity Physics -> Enable Integrity Checks) the `PhysicsTemporalCoherenceInfo` component data of rigid body entities is validated against the internal state of the broadphase, to make sure the data is as expected. This allows detecting unexpected external modifications to this important bookkeeping data.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Parallelize jacobian updates for substepping without consideration of solver phases since there are no data dependencies\n* Safer access to nodes in `BoundingVolumeHierarchy` of broadphase, ensuring there are no out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed a crash when scheduling an IBodyPairsJob and an IJacobiansJob in a situation without any body pairs or jacobians present in the simulation.\n* Division by zero errors causing NaN values when a Capsule degenerates into a Sphere (occurs when Height = 2*Radius)\n* ConvexHull connectivity for flat convex colliders\n* Referenced prefabs in bakers with built-in joints incorrectly displayed the anchor position when the `Auto Configure Connected Anchor` flag was enabled.\n* Correctly compute the expansion space for convex / composite collision queries, preventing missed collisions in certain cases.\n* Pass the \"Build Static Tree\" flag to tree build job in single-threaded version of static tree update.\n* A specific use case has been patched which applies only to Mac Silicon devices using editor version 2022.3 and when a negative scale is used in the transform of a BoxCollider: The transform calculation from localToWorld matrix to quaternion doesn't return the correct value due to differences in the calculation of rsqrt(x). This is exhibited as BoxGeometry orientations returning a strange quaternion value when the scale is negative. This bug has been fixed in the editor.\n* Prevent invalid entries in incrementally built broadphase if it was built non-incrementally previously.\n\n### Security"

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Motors authored via built-in component, api, or custom component now use spring frequency and the damping ratio to fine-tune the motor behaviour.\n* New `Collider.BakeTransform` function which allows deforming a collider at runtime. This function is implemented for all collider types except the `TerrainCollider` and applies a provided affine transformation to the collider geometry, rotating, translating, scaling and shearing it accordingly. The geometric transformation will be either perfect for mesh types, or approximate for primitives. Specific deformations will be perfect even for primitives depending on the type of deformation and the primitive's parametrization. As such a `BoxCollider` with identity orientation in local space will be uniformly scaled, updating its width, height and length perfectly, if the provided affine transformation is a pure scaling matrix.\n* The broadphase can now be changed to operate incrementally using the `PhysicsStepAuthoring` component (see parameters `Incremental Dynamic Broadphase` and `Incremental Static Broadphase`), and the `PhysicsStep` Entities components. When the feature is enabled, the bounding volume hierarchy inside the broadphase, used for spatial acceleration during collision detection and for collider queries such as ray and collider casts, is no longer built from scratch every frame, but incrementally updated from one frame to the next. This can lead to drastic performance improvements for scenes with large numbers of rigid bodies of which only a very small subset changes between frames, that is, changes to rigid body transformations or colliders are rare. This feature can be enabled for dynamic bodies and static bodies separately, which makes it applicable to large and mostly static worlds with massive numbers of static rigid bodies and a reasonable number of dynamic bodies. By default this feature is disabled.\n* Through the new `CompoundCollider.Update` function, the shape or transformation of children in a compound collider can now be safely modified. By calling the provided function, the compound collider's bounding volume information and optionally also its mass properties are updated in accordance with the modifications of its child colliders, thereby ensuring correct behavior in collision detection and collider queries.\n* Added a new `CollisionWorld.Clone()` function which allows cloning a collision world and deep copying select colliders which otherwise would be shared across clones. Deep copying is important in cases where the collision world clone is used over multiple frames and colliders are modified, which is frequently the case in Netcode environments with lag compensation for physics queries (see `Unity.NetCode.PhysicsWorldHistorySingleton`). For these cases, the colliders which are likely to be modified or deleted (such as colliders in dynamic rigid bodies) can now be deep copied, ensuring independent collision world clones. Without deep copying in these cases, modifying colliders in the original collision world after having cloned it will inadvertently also affect the clone, which can lead to erroneous collision queries and crashes.\n* By setting the \"Provides Contacts\" option in built-in collider authoring components, users can now enable collision event reporting for physically simulated rigid bodies. The collision events can be received by using an `ICollisionEventsJob`.\n\n### Changed\n\n* When baking a built-in hinge joint as a rotation motor, the Joint.Motor.Force parameter must be non-zero. This value is baked into the maximum impulse of the motor.\n* Add missing `[BurstCompile]` attributes in the collider blob systems to ensure maximum performance.\n* In `EnsureUniqueColliderBlobSystem`, prevent extra delay in adding the required unique collider blob cleanup components by using a different ECB system. This change also batches the corresponding commands with the commands coming from other physics systems, preventing an unnecessary extra sync point in the overall simulation.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Possible race condition in debug displays when modifying the geometry of colliders.\n* Prevent unnecessary memory allocations in builds due to the editor-only debug display.\n* Fixed errors caused by memory corruption when selecting mesh-based custom Physics Shape Authoring components in the editor.\n* Prevent slowdowns caused by physics analytics data gathering through job parallelization and by disabling the analytics jobs when editor analytics are disabled.\n* Prevent crash in debug display caused by dangling system pointer in certain cases.\n* Fully remove any trace of the integrity checks unless we are in the editor or in a development build.\n* Fixed an issue that prevented contacts in the Physics Debug Display to show up when Draw Contacts was enabled."

Thus far, any scale, including a purely uniform scale, was baked into the Unity Physics collider geometry instead and the corresponding entity's `LocalTransform.Scale` property was set to 1 rather than to the desired uniform scale value. This is no longer the case, and users can now expect to find the uniform edit-time scale they assign to their game objects also in the resultant, baked entities during run-time, making run-time modifications of already uniformly scaled objects much more intuitive and less cumbersome.\n* Rigid bodies baked from game objects which have any world-space scale or shear at edit-time can now be scaled at runtime using their `LocalTransform` component's `Scale` property. Previously, this was not possible. Runtime scaling using the `LocalTransform.Scale` property was only possible when the edit-time scale of the baked game object was identity, and no shear was present.\n* `Entity` references in `CompoundCollider` children are no longer automatically set during baking since these references are not guaranteed to be valid in the `World` after baking. Only those entity references that appear in components and buffers, such as the `PhysicsColliderKeyEntityPair` buffer, are always guaranteed to be valid. Note that the `PhysicsColliderKeyEntityPair` buffer is still present on entities which contain a baked compound collider. Via collider keys, this buffer provides a mapping between the child colliders and the original entities that they were in at bake time.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Prevent race condition between the systems that produce the debug draw data and the display system that renders the data. This allows the debug data to be fully produced before the display system attempts to render it.\n* Fix draw of collider entities without `LocalToWorld` component when selecting `PostIntegration` in the Physics Debug Display.\n* Avoid leftover debug draw when switching scenes and new scene has no `Physics Debug Display`.\n* Mass properties debug display now correctly considers the rigid body scale, and correctly handles cases with unphysical inertia tensors.\n* Custom mass properties specified using the `Override Default Mass Distribution` option in the custom `Physics Body Authoring` component now work correctly even if no collider is present.\n* A rigid body's uniform scale value (`LocalTransform.Scale`) is now always considered correctly in the simulation. Previously, when the rigid body entity also contained a `PostTransformMatrix` component, its uniform scale was not applied to its collider and mass properties, leading to erroneous mass properties and missed collisions (if uniform scale > 1) or ghost collisions (if uniform scale < 1).\n* Collider debug display now correctly displays colliders with uniform scale other than 1 in accordance with their `LocalTransform` component's `Scale` value.\n* Collider debug display now correctly displays rigid body entities with `Parent` component."

        "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Tests for ensuring proper joint anchor and mass property baking\n* new demo scene (5m. Collider Modifications) demonstrating how to create colliders during runtime\n* Utility functions were added for the creation of MeshCollider blob assets from UnityEngine.Mesh, UnityEngine.MeshData and UnityEngine.MeshDataArray. These functions are located in the MeshCollider class as `MeshCollider.Create' variants with different function signatures.\n* Users can now verify if a collider blob is unique, and make it unique easily if required. The newly introduced `PhysicsCollider.IsUnique` property lets users check if a `PhysicsCollider` is unique and turn it into a unique collider if desired via the function `PhysicsCollider.MakeUnique()`. Making a collider unique with this function also takes care of the collider blob lifetime management and will automatically dispose it if it is no longer needed.\n* Added a custom entity inspector for the collider blob asset stored in the `PhysicsCollider` component. This inspector allows for two-way interaction with the collider. The displayed values update in accordance with the collider's latest runtime state, and the UI can be used in order to interact with the collider manually when it is unique (see `PhysicsCollider.IsUnique`). Among others, this lets users try out different material properties at runtime, such as friction and restitution, or modify the collider's size, local position or orientation.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Changed the `bool` flags in the `Physics Debug Display` authoring component for drawing colliders, collider edges and axis-aligned bounding boxes of colliders to an enum called `DisplayMode`. With the display mode you can now choose whether to draw these elements at the beginning of the simulation step or at the end of the simulation step after the rigid bodies have been integrated, meaning, they have been moved forward in time.\n* Convert SystemBase to ISystems.\n* Joint baking for built-in 3D physics joints has been improved, leading to the expected simulation results. Now, when the `Spring` and `Damping` properties in Configurable and Character Joints are both set to 0 for limits, a hard limit is modeled. This is equivalent to the behavior in built-in 3D physics. Also, the `Damping` parameter is now correctly converted from damping coefficient to the Unity Physics damping ratio for joints, yielding the correct damping force. Furthermore, joint baking now considers the scale of game objects. Anchor points are now affected by the scale accordingly.\n* The formula which converts the user-specified joint relaxation parameters (spring frequency and damping ratio) to the internal constraint regularization parameters (tau and damping) was rewritten as an optimized closed-form expression with constant time complexity. The regularization parameters can now be efficiently computed regardless of the chosen solver iteration count.\n* `PhysicsGraphicalSmoothing` has been added to `.WithAll<>()` from `.WithAllRW<>()` in the `SmoothedDynamicBodiesQuery` variable within `SmoothRigidBodiesGraphicalMotion.cs` system file.\n* Updating APIs to `GetScriptingDefineSymbols()` and `SetScriptingDefineSymbols()`.\n* Included ragdoll authoring in documentation\n* Prefab instances will now contain unique colliders if the \"force unique\" collider authoring option is used. This allows collider runtime modifications without manual collider blob cloning now also on prefab instances. Note that prefab instances that contain \"force unique\" colliders will be made unique only after the next physics system group update following the prefab instantiation. Until then, the `PhysicsCollider.IsUnique` property will be false. If users require a unique collider immediately after prefab instantiation for runtime collider modifications, they can safely use the new `PhysicsCollider.MakeUnique()` function immediately after instantiation.\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.8\n* The internal component `DrawComponent`, required by the `Physics Debug Display`, is now hidden in the hierarchy.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* The `Constraint.DefaultSpringDamping` variable was deprecated. Use `Constraint.DefaultDampingRatio` instead. The same applies to the `Constraint.SpringDamping` property which was deprecated. Instead the new `Constraint.DampingRatio` property should be used.\n\n### Removed\n\n* Remove unused internal debug draw functionalities which were causing slowdowns during world initialization\n\n### Fixed\n\n* BuildCompoundCollidersBakingSystem no longer leaks memory when the world is disposed.\n* Convert SystemBase to ISystems\n* When using the built-in `Rigidbody` and `Collider` authoring components, the inertia tensor of the resultant rigid body in Unity Physics is now set correctly in all situations. Previously, in certain cases, the default inertia tensor was used.\n* A problem which prevented the solver to respect the user-specified joint spring frequency and damping ratios in certain cases has been fixed, enabling physically-plausible modeling of joints under all operating conditions.\n* Link to changelog in documentation now fixed\n* Physics Shape components with type Mesh now correctly only use the Custom Mesh for MeshCollider creation if specified rather than also incorrectly including the game object's render mesh and any render mesh found in the game object's children. The previous erroneous behavior could lead to significant performance problems in the narrow phase (contact creation) of the physics simulation group for affected meshes.\n* Updated documentation to reflect that the Built-In TerrainCollider is not yet supported by Unity Physics"

Instead, schedule the right number of jobs for the dispatch pair phases created by the scheduler to prevent scheduling and processing overheads. This leads to speed-ups in the time consumed by jobs in the `SolveAndIntegrateSystem` specifically in cases with low to medium joint and contact counts.\n* The `PhysicsColliderKeyEntityPair` buffer is now added only when needed and its internal capacity of the buffer is set to zero, ensuring its content always lives outside of the chunk. This way, we don't unnecessarily increase the rigid body sizes in chunks, allowing for a larger number of rigid bodies in a single chunk, which improves performance.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed regression in accessibility of `PhysicsShapeAuthoring` API. The functions `GetCapsuleProperties()` and `SetCapsule()` were made internal by accident during the move of the custom physics authoring components from the package API to a package sample and are now public again."
