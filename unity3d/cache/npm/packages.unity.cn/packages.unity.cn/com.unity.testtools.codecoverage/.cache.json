The `pathReplacePatterns` option allows stripping and replacing specific sections from the paths that are stored in the coverage results xml files.\n\nSee the [Upgrade guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/upgrade-guide.html) if upgrading to Code Coverage package version 1.2.\n\n### Improvements\n- The size of the coverage result files and the Code Coverage session duration have been optimized. At the start of the session a coverage xml result file is generated which includes all the lines but with zero coverage. The following coverage xml result files that are generated within a Code Coverage session include only the coverage data of the visited lines.\n- Added Help IconButton in the toolbar in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html).\n- Updated the mechanic for opening the containing folder, change the location or reset to the default location for *Results Location* and *Report History Location*.\n- Refactored the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) UI to include a new *Report Options* section and removing the word 'Generate' from the options.\n- Introduced new selection buttons under the *Included Assemblies* dropdown in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html); use the *All* button to select all the assemblies in the project. Use the *Assets* button to select only the assemblies under the `Assets` folder. Use the *Packages* button to select only the Packages' assemblies. If searching, the buttons will apply only to the assemblies visible in the list.\n- Updated [What's new](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/whats-new.html) and [Upgrade guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/upgrade-guide.html) pages in the documentation.\n- Added [Using relative paths in path filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html#using-relative-paths-in-path-filters) section in documentation.\n- Updated the editor and console logs; added information about the assembly and path filters, improved coverage session logs.\n- Improved the progress bars for `Writing coverage results` and `Generating the report`.\n- Added an icon for the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html).\n- Updated documentation to match version 1.2.0.\n\n### Features\n- Added `Pause Recording` and `Resume Recording` buttons in the toolbar in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html).\n- Added `Log Verbosity Level` setting in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which allows setting the verbosity level for the editor and console logs.\n- Added `Additional Reports` option in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which if checked [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/generic-test), [Cobertura](https://cobertura.github.io/cobertura) and [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) reports will be generated. Added `generateAdditionalReports` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html).\n- Added `Test Runner References` report option in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which if checked includes test references to the generated coverage results and enables the [Coverage by test methods](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/HowToInterpretResults.html#coverage-by-test-methods) section in the HTML report, allowing you to see how each test contributes to the overall coverage. Added `generateTestReferences` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html).\n- Added `Auto Open Report` option in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which if checked the coverage report will open automatically after it has been generated.\n- Added `pathFiltersFromFile` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows specifying an external file which contains a list of path filters. When this file contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories.\n- Added `dontClear` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows coverage results to be accumulated after every code coverage session. If not passed the results are cleared before a new session. For more information see [Generate combined report from EditMode and PlayMode tests](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html#generate-combined-report-from-editmode-and-playmode-tests).\n- When the `pathFilters` option or the `pathFiltersFromFile` option in *-coverageOptions* contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories."
